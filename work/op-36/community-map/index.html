              With Operation 36 Golf (Op 36), coaches had a structured golf
              program to deliver to existing golfers. However, they needed to
              grow their programs by bringing in new golfers, but they couldn't
              just rely on just word of mouth. We also wanted a way for users
              that found our website to find an Op 36 program near them. That's
              why the Community Map and Lead Manager were born in the web app.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Community Map is a tool for prospective students to find an Op
              36 program near them and easily connect with a coach. After they
              locate a program that they're interested in, they fill out a short
              form that describes what they are looking for, which is then sent
              to the coach's Lead Manager as a lead. From there, the coach can
              keep track of leads, add notes whenever they contact a lead, and
              easily send invitations to the program (and app) once the lead is
              ready to join.
            </p>
            <p>
              With recent updates, the Community Map now links to the
              <a
                rel="noreferrer noopener"
                href="/work/op-36/more/#registration-engine"
                class="links"
                >New Registration Engine</a
              >. This allows prospective students to not only inquire about Op
              36 programs but also directly register for them, reducing a lot of
              friction for students and coaches alike.

              I asked our team - some coaches, some parents of students, all
              potential adult students:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                How do you determine if a program is right for you (and/or your
                kids)?
              </li>
              <li>
                As a coach, what do you want to know about your prospective
                students?
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Then, I defined our flow for
              <strong>both students and coaches</strong>. Due to technical
              limitations at the time, I couldn’t show class info at each
              location, but I was able to include most of the other info.

              Taking inspiration from apps like Google Maps and Asana, I
              designed a searchable map, location landing page view, and leads
              manager. I also tried a list view of communities to see if users
              preferred that (or if the map was too complex for us to develop
              for the MVP).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another area I wasn't sure about was the location and style of the
              “Request Program Information” form, so I tried some variations to
              get feedback there too.
            </p>

            <p>
              To see which variations were preferred, I created two prototypes
              for our team to test using the list/map and form variations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our team’s feedback suggested that the map view was less
              overwhelming because there were
              <strong>more visuals than text</strong>, but the form with the
              dark background was better because it <strong>stood out</strong>.
              They also pointed out that we should have a
              <strong
                >form for students that don’t have a location near them</strong
              >
              and a
              <strong
                >button in the leads manager that sends an invite to the
                lead</strong
              >
              (so no need to navigate to the Invites page, and you can quickly
              invite many leads).

              We didn’t define a threshold for “success,” but we did track
              metrics in our admin portal. We have accrued thousands of views
              plus hundreds of leads (and students created from leads) every
              month, so our feature was quite impactful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some coaches also told us that they got so many leads that they
              have waitlists, which was a sign that their programs are doing
              well.

            <p>
              This was actually one of the first features I helped design here.
              It has been updated quite a few times since the initial release,
              and many more updates are in the works. Nevertheless, we would
              have benefitted from more touchpoints with coaches and families
              outside of our team, especially with a beta test build.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Do load testing. As we grew our number of facilities, the map
                and landing pages took longer and longer to load. We eventually
                had to implement caching and create landing pages not connected
                to the map.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask families that are not part of any Op 36 program to test the
                program search and “Request program information” flow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Learn more about how coaches track and manage their leads (if
                they do). We later learned that some coaches wanted to import
                leads from other sources. We also learned that some coaches
                won’t respond to their leads because they are busy or don’t want
                them, which makes us look bad.
              </li>
