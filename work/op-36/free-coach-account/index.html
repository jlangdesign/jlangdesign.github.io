              The Operation 36 Golf (Op 36) website provides a brief overview of
              the app's features. However, if a prospective coach wanted to
              learn more, they had to sign up for a demo. There was no way for
              them to explore the app without some sort of commitment. We
              suspected that this barrier reduced signups. Due to technical
              constraints, we couldn't provide a "trial" version of the Op 36
              app where some features were free yet limited. Instead, we opted
              for a way to create a "free" coach account where they could watch
              videos about each feature and educate themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              To do this, we created the Free Coach Account registration form in
              the web app. As a prospective coach went through the form, they
              provided our team with enough info to personalize a demo for them.
              Our sales team could fill out a program planner for them and show
              them how the Op 36 program would be a fit for their particular
              facility. Once the prospective coach finished registration, they
              not only had videos about each feature, but they also had access
              to video courses in our Coach Academy - step-by-step videos on how
              to run a successful program. All of these free services would
              hopefully motivate them to book a demo and sign up.

              This feature was meant to help the sales team, so I started out by
              <strong>asking them what they want to know</strong> about the
              lead. These details would form each step of the task flow. There
              were a lot of questions, so we decided to split the flow into a
              <strong>“registration”</strong> phase and an
              <strong>“onboarding”</strong> phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also studied the different types of transitions between
              questions in form builders and fitness apps’ onboarding flows. One
              common technique for making long registration flows less
              intimidating was
              <strong>putting each question on its own page</strong>, so I kept
              that in mind.
            </p>

            <h3 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="ideation">

            </figure>
            <p>
              Then, I started exploring designs in Figma for the registration,
              onboarding, and dashboard experience for the coach and the sales
              lead manager for our team.
            </p>
            <p>
              I kept the designs simple for the coach so they could be
              <strong>responsive</strong> and so the experience feels
              <strong>less overwhelming</strong>. I also experimented with the
              <strong>number of questions visible</strong> at one time so we
              could do <strong>A/B testing</strong> with our team.
            </p>

            <p>
              I couldn’t test these designs on prospective leads, so I
              <strong>asked our team and stakeholders</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest takeaway was that
              <strong>limiting the view to 1-2 questions</strong> at a time
              provided the best experience. We could
              <strong
                >group closely related questions into the same view</strong
              >
              to avoid having too many steps.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than that, they were happy with the simple designs and
              <strong>suggested a few extra questions</strong>, like “Why are
              you creating this account?”

              I built the <strong>frontend for the coach experience</strong>,
              while my teammate built the frontend for our internal lead manager
              and backend for the entire system.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most of my time was spent making the questions a reusable React
              component so it would be
              <strong>easier for us to add questions in the future</strong>.
              That component had to handle different types of
              <strong>validation and edge cases</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We demoed to our team every week and let them try clicking through
              it themselves, but most of the
              <strong>changes that they requested were minor</strong>.
            </p>

              We tracked the number of leads, demos, and sales that this system
              generated over a few quarters.
            </p>
            <p>
              While we received hundreds of leads, and some of those booked
              demos (either on their own or from our sales team reaching out),
              <strong>none of them converted to sales</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, we determined that our
              <strong>current method of gathering leads</strong> - asking them
              to book a demo when on our website -
              <strong>was more effective</strong>. We stopped working on this
              new coach registration system.

              While it was worth a try, and it improved some metrics, this
              feature
              <strong>failed to move us towards our sales objectives</strong>,
              even though we sunk months into planning and building this feature
              and spent several more months tracking metrics.

              Looking back, there were
              <strong
                >several ways that we could have done more user research</strong
              >. That could have improved our idea and increased the chance of
              success, or it could have shown us that our idea wasn’t viable
              early on before investing development time.

              <li>
                Listen in on sales calls (cold calls, demos, closings) to
                understand how our sales team causes leads to close
              </li>
              <li>
                Ask coaches to describe to us the last time they were sold on a
                product. This would help us discover other techniques.
              </li>
              <li>
                Test our assumptions and prototypes on some of our existing
                customers (closest we can get to leads), not just our team.
              </li>
              <li>
                After releasing, measure churn at certain parts of the flow
                (registration, onboarding, dashboard) to find problem areas.
