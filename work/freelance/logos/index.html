	          I worked with:
	        </p>
          <ol>
            <li>NCSU's Leadership in Public Science (LiPS), a new faculty cluster at the university.</li>
            <li>The Association for Higher Education Communications Technology Advancement (AHECTA), an existing group of video professionals.</li>
            <li>No. IV E-sports Club, a new e-sports cafe in Raleigh, NC.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            to do initial ideation, make revisions based on feedback, and export the final files in different formats.
          </p>

	        <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">NCSU's Leadership in Public Science</h4>
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Objectives</h5>
					<p>
		        Design a logo for the Leadership in Public Science (LiPS), a new faculty cluster at NCSU. It needs to express the identity of the cluster without clashing with the NCSU brand. Ideally, it shouldn't use the typical science imagery, like an atom (none of the members at the time were physicists).
	        </p>
					<p>
						(This logo request began as a contest. LiPS would contact the winner of the contest and collaborate with them to refine the logo.)
					</p>
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Ideation</h5>
					<p>
		        Since this was a contest, I wasn't able to consult the members of LiPS for more details. Therefore, I first started by researching LiPS on the NCSU website to form a clearer identity. I noticed themes of communication, connection, and interaction. After brainstorming scientific concepts with those themes, I came up with the idea of a Petri dish. It contained cultures shaped like continents with nodes connected by lines - all representing the network and spread of scientific knowledge across the world. The angles created by the lines also aligned with NCSU's angular brand imagery.
	        </p>
					<p>
						LiPS really liked the "culture" and "Petri dish" metaphors as well as the idea of connections and interactions. However, the focus on the Earth and overseas connections didn't quite resonate with them. They invited me to their next cluster meeting to get more feedback and context.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the meeting, we discussed other imagery to replace the Atlantic Ocean (but still evoke a sense of "connection"), different versions of the logo that we'd need, and how to make the Petri dish concept more clear. With that, I removed the metaphors to the Earth, then explored more abstract representations with circles, hexagons, and even wolves (because they are social animals <em>and</em> the NCSU mascot).
					</p>
					<p>
						The cluster thought that the wolves were interesting, but no one outside of NCSU would recognize them. As for the hexagons, the form was visually appealing, but the sense of "connection" wasn't as strong. Thus, we decided to work off of a combination of the circular and hexagonal concepts. LiPS suggested reducing the number of circles and connections to simplify the design, then adding more connections coming out of the largest circle (representing LiPS) to look more like "tendrils" spreading outwards. We also decided to try a version where the largest circle was at the bottom, and we liked that one the most.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next order of business was to add the text and refine the edges so it looked more like a Petri dish. The NCSU brand at the time didn't have explicitly defined guidelines for clusters, so I tried finding examples of other NCSU logos online. While the cluster wanted to emphasize their own name, we noticed that most of the other logos made NCSU's name primary, so we kept that hierarchy in th end. As for the dish, I tried different stroke weights to form more continuous edges - some uniform, some tapered. I also created opaque and transparent versions.
					</p>
					<p>
						LiPS preferred the opaque sides, even though Petri dishes are transparent. They then shared some tips for refining the edges. I used that feedback to create three final versions for them to vote on. After they unanimously voted on one version of the Petri dish, I created the variations (standalone, horizontal, and vertical) and exported them to the required formats.
					</p>
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Results</h5>
	        <p>
		        The final concept consisted of a Petri dish with circular nodes branching out like slime mold, conveying connection and communication.
	        </p>
					<p>
						Each variation of the logo was exported in black and red - NCSU's primary colors for logos - in CMYK and RGB modes, and in EPS, JPG, and PNG. The set also included an "illegal" horizontal variation, where the cluster's name was above NCSU's name since LiPS requested it.
