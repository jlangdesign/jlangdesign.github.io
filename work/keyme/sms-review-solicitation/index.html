					<h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Note: Some content cannot be displayed due to the NDA.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the main motivators for copying a key at a KeyMe kiosk is social proof - aka ratings and reviews. The more ratings a given kiosk has, the more credible it seems. However, while every kiosk has customers, not all of them leave reviews on their experiences. Therefore, kiosks with fewer reviews seem less trustworthy, and new customers are reluctant to try them out. We needed to encourage more reviews to draw more customers.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the time, we solicited reviews via email. After a customer's order was fulfilled, the customer received an email asking about their experience. They were then directed to the Google Buisiness Profile (GBP) page for the kiosk and asked to leave a review. This method was ineffective because:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Not every customer reads every email.</li>
						<li>The customer's email client may have thought the review solicitation was a marketing email and moved it to spam.</li>
						<li>The experience might not have been fresh in the customer's mind by the time they saw the solicitation.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Our solution was a new feature - SMS receipts. Instead of receiving the traditional email receipt and review solicitation email, customers  receive an SMS (text message) containing both a receipt and review solicitation. The SMS asks the customer to let us know about their experience and includes a link to a "landing page" on our website. That page encourages the customer to leave a review and/or contact our CX team to resolve any issues they may have had.
					</p>
					<p>
						We hypothesized that switching to SMS receipts and review solicitations would be more successful because:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Customers are more likely to see the SMS than an email.</li>
						<li>The SMS encouraged a review while the experience was still fresh in the customer's memory.</li>
						<li>The solicitation was in the same view as the receipt details, so it was obvious which order the solicitation applied to.</li>
						<li>The SMS made it easier to get help (if needed) and then leave a review since both actions were on the same page.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Due to the complexity of order status notifications for shipped keys (vs. keys dispensed right from the kiosk), we limited our SMS receipts feature to dispense-only orders - which also happened to be our most common type of order. Customers that placed orders including at least one shipped key still received the traditional email receipt and review solicitation. In a future iteration, the feature could be expanded to cover shipped orders too.
					</p>
          <p>
            (Full process story currently in progress - stay tuned!)
          </p>

          <h3 class="story-section">Results</h3>
					<p>
            We first released the feature to a subset of kiosks. Within two weeks, review volume increased by 200% to 300%. We later released to all kiosks, and after another two weeks, review volume increased by 121%. However, the average rating also dropped 28%, possibliy because we made it easier to leave any review - including bad ones.
          </p>
					<p>
						Although a drop in rating wasn't ideal, we considered this feature successful because it increased review volume - our main goal and the most important SEO metric. Then, we started testing different landing page designs to see which one leads to the best balance between higher volume and higher ratings. We found that using emojis encourages reviews, and making it easier to get help with issues encourages more positive reviews.

						<li>Make it easier for the coach to create end-of-semester progress reports for their students and parents.</li>
						<li>Show students their progress in each part of the Op 36 program so they feel like they are improving, which will increase retention.</li>
					</ol>

          <h4 class="story-chapter">Research</h4>

          <p>
	          Due to feature requests and coaches’ current methods for assembling reports, we knew that it wasn’t easy for coaches to present progress at end of the semester to students. We needed this report to complete the Op 36 lifecycle of playing, training, and learning.
	        </p>
					<p>
						We had an idea of what coaches would want, but we wanted to verify our assumptions. Thus, we asked a few of our coaches, “If you could generate a 1-page progress report for a student, what would you include?”
					</p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-research-2.webp" alt="Research for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>
						We limited the first version to 1 page because we wanted to:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Have an MVP to test as soon as possible</li>
						<li>Know what was most important to our coaches</li>
						<li>Keep it easy for parents and students to digest</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Ideation</h4>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-ideation-1.webp" alt="Ideation for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
	          From our coaches’ responses, we created a large list of desired items. Then, we designed a few iterations that included the most common responses - trying to squeeze as much as possible into one page - then shared it with our coaches for additional feedback.
	        </p>

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Prototyping</h4>
          <p>
	          To our surprise, we learned that the report now had too much data! Sure, it was useful, but parents and students probably wouldn’t feel excited or want to read through all of those tiny numbers, which defeats its purpose. It didn’t look friendly.
	        </p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-ideation-2.webp" alt="Ideation for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>
						One coach suggested that we design it to resemble an award as opposed to a page with rows and rows of numbers and icons (AKA a typical report). He shared his thoughts through a call with us, so we also got to learn more about his current process for generating reports.
					</p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-ideation-3.webp" alt="Ideation for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>
						That coach’s reasoning for the award concept made sense, and we knew that our printed certificates were popular products in our store, so we decided to design a few more variations with that in mind.
					</p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-ideation-4.webp" alt="Ideation for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>
						We reduced the amount of data displayed, made the numbers and icons bigger, and added a big badge. Each variation had slightly more data in certain sections than others.
					</p>
					<p>
						From all of the research we had done so far, we felt like we were pretty close to an initial solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						We sent out an email poll so we could quickly reach out to all of our coaches, get their vote for their favorite design, and see if there were any other critical pieces missing.
					</p>
					<p>
						A few days after sending the poll, we reviewed the results. There were a few pieces of feedback, but we figured we could incorporate those in a later iteration - they didn’t sound like dealbreakers. Thus, we proceeded with the most popular design.
					</p>
					<figure>

            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>
						Finally, we had to design the flow for selecting the students and generating the reports in our web app. Using what we had learned from both historic and recent research, we included the ability to:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Select multiple students at one time</li>
						<li>Apply a generic note to all students if desired</li>
						<li>
							Export the reports as one file for easy printing
							<ol>
								<li>In the future, we also want the ability to export them separately for easier emailing</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>

          <h4 class="story-chapter">Development</h4>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-development.webp" alt="Development for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
						</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
	          As usual, we prepared the project for handoff to our developer with tasks, specs, endpoint response data to use, and test cases (including edge cases).
	        </p>
					<p>
						However, after the developer was done, I later refactored the code for the report itself to improve the structure, styling, and readability.
					</p>

          <h4 class="story-chapter">Marketing + Release</h4>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="player-journey-marketing.webp" alt="Marketing for Player Journey Report." class="project-media">

						</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
	          Prior to release, I also worked on a drip campaign with my teammate. After deciding on the timing, messaging, and graphics, we launched the new report, then continued to remind our coaches about its existence and utility over time through our emails.
	        </p>
					<p>
						We planned the emails based off of the time of the semester. For example, during the middle of the semester, we promoted it as a mid-semester progress report, whereas near the end, we pitched it as a great way for your students to remember you and your program after the last day of classes.
					</p>

          <h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="results">Results</h4>

          </figure>
          <p>
	          After releasing, we got a lot of emails where coaches told us they were excited to use the report, showed us how they were using the report, and/or shared ideas for potential improvements, so we knew our coaches were using it. It sounds like it was a success.
	        </p>
					<p>
						We knew our coaches are happy with it, but we still had to measure our retention over time to see if the report helped us meet the business objective of improved retention.

          <h4 class="story-chapter">Reflection</h4>
          <p>
	          Judging from the feedback, the Player Journey Report was one of our more successful features. However, it could have been even better if we were able to get more feedback from other types of users, such as the recipients of the reports (students and parents) and coaches that don’t normally use our reporting features.
	        </p>
					<p>
						We also ran into a lot of technical issues along the way, so we didn’t have time to set up a good tracking mechanism to uncover usage patterns.
					</p>
					<ul>
	          <li>Address technical debt ASAP. Our outdated React version meant that we were stuck with a library that didn’t allow us to include the student’s profile photo, which would make the reports easier to distinguish from one another and personalize them for the students.</li>
						<li>Talk to coaches that don’t use reports at all and learn why.</li>
						<li>Get feedback from actual parents and students.</li>
						<li>Get feedback on the report generation flow.</li>
						<li>Start thinking about what data to track earlier on in the project so we have more time to incorporate tracking.</li>
	        </ul>
