					<h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Note: Some content cannot be displayed due to the NDA.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Customers can duplicate a variety of vehicle keys at the KeyMe kiosk. However, some vehicle keys still require a locksmith to duplicate. This means that we have to connect those customers to locksmiths via the kiosk. Initially, the kiosk would ask the customer for their contact info to send to a locksmith. Then, the locksmith would later contact the customer to gather more details and set up an appointment. This approach was ineffective because:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Lack of info</strong> - The customer didn't know enough about the process to feel comfortable sharing their contact info.</li>
						<li><strong>Inefficient communication</strong> - Getting all of the required details required a lot of back-and-forth conversation between the locksmith and customer. Also, not all customers responded to contact. This led to frustration and unbooked jobs.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						To address these issues, we designed a flow that connects these customers to a locksmith service request form in our web portal. Instead of asking for contact info right away, the kiosk explains the process to the customer, then texts the form's link to their mobile device. The customer can then fill out the form, giving the locksmith all of the info they need to book the job. Furthermore, the form provided more info on the duplication process as the customer filled it out, which helped build trust with the customer.
					</p>
					<p>
						We completed this project in two phases:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Phase 1</strong> - We started with an unpolished, existing locksmith service request form in our web portal and completely redesigned it to improve the user experience. This form and web portal existed for customers that discovered KeyMe's vehicle key services by browsing the internet (without visiting a kiosk).</li>
						<li><strong>Phase 2</strong> - We then modified the kiosk flow to send the form instead of accepting all contact info directly. We also modified the web form slightly to improve the transition from kiosk to web, like autofilling some fields if the customer came from the kiosk and not directly from the KeyMe website. This flow benefits customers that tried duplicating their vehicle key at a KeyMe kiosk but couldn't do so because they actually needed a locksmith.</li>
					</ul>

In the old journey, the customer merely sent their contact info to the locksmith via the kiosk, and the locksmith and customer had to have long conversations to get all of the info needed for the job.

					<p>
						We mainly wanted to increase the number of jobs booked for vehicle key duplication via kiosk. However, we also wanted to increase the number booked directly from our web portal form. From prior research on our customers, we were planning to connect the kiosk experience to the web portal experience (or something similar) so our customers would have an easier time typing. Thus, we had two objectives:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Make the service request form in our web portal easier to fill out.</li>
						<li>
							Streamline info collection for vehicle key duplication jobs from kiosk customers.
							<ol>
								<li>We hypothesized that if the new web form was successful, we could direct kiosk customers to it instead of asking them to type the info directly into the kiosk. Personal devices are easier to type on than large kiosk screens.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="research">Research: Customers see too many steps and not enough transparency</h4>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">User Research</h5>
					<p>
						We couldn't interview actual customers at the time due to security concerns and financial constraints. Instead, we asked others from the organization to provide feedback on current and proposed designs from a customer's perspective. This and data from the analytics team allowed us to better understand our customers and their journeys.

She is a young mom who recently bought a new house and a used car, and she wants a spare car key. She struggles to find options that are both affordable and convenient." class="project-media">
            <figcaption class="caption">
							According to our analytics team, the average kiosk customer is female, in their mid-20s to mid-40s, and going through a stressful time in their lives (like buying a house). We didn't have demographic data from our web portal users, so we used our kiosk customer persona for the web portal redesign.

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Design Research</h5>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="ideation">Ideation: Better web form navigation and connecting kiosk to mobile</h4>
					<p>
						Based on our research, we brainstormed several different options for the web portal form and kiosk experiences.
					</p>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Web Portal Form</h5>
					<p>
						Our ideation for the web portal form focused on the navigation system between steps. We explored different questions, orders of questions, and question formats as well.
					</p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="locksmith-service-ideation-navigation.webp" alt="Four ideas for form navigation: The current accordion style; a thicker, more spaced-out accordion style; a simple progress bar; and a progress bar with discrete, labeled steps." class="project-media">

							Examples of changes to questions and the order of questions.
						</figcaption>
          </figure>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Kiosk</h5>
					<p>
						The kiosk is more sensitive to changes and requires a longer release cycle, so we didn't explore any large layout changes - only minor changes to copy and imagery. We did consider linking to the form via a QR code on the screen vs. asking the customer for their mobile number. However, the QR code could've caused accessibility issues, and we would've had to test libraries for generating unique codes. The mobile number input was the safest choice and the lowest level of effort (LOE) for the time being.

            <figcaption class="caption">

						</figcaption>
          </figure>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Design System</h5>
					<p>
						One detail that users noted was that the kiosk's and web portal form's UIs looked very different, as if they were from different companies. We tried designs where the kiosk's more colorful design system matched the web portal form's more minimalist design system - and vice versa. However, changing the kiosk to match would've taken too long. On the other hand, changing the web portal to match would've resulted in color contrast issues. Therefore, we kept both design systems as-is for the time being.

							How the kiosk and web portal form would look if they had the same design systems.
						</figcaption>
          </figure>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="prototyping">Prototyping: Separate form pages with a progress bar performed best</h4>
					<p>
						We tested the web portal designs and kiosk designs separately with our users and locksmiths, then combined the best-performing designs from each into a single prototype for final testing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The key takeaways were:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Our users preferred separate pages for each step/section in the form, and they liked the progress bar that displayed each step with its label.
							<ol>
								<li>Even though it would require a higher LOE, the progress bar made the form least overwhelming while still providing transparency.</li>
								<li>The accordions occupied too much space vertically and felt too busy on mobile. They might have worked better if the form had fewer steps.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							On the kiosk page with the key benefits, the key benefits in the same row were easier to digest instead of in three separate rows.
						</li>
						<li>
							Our locksmiths said the form needs to ask for the customer's general availability, not a specific date and time.
							<ol>
								<li>Locksmiths can't guarantee that the customer's chosen date and time are available, so they need a range of dates and times instead.</li>
								<li>Therefore, we can only collect the customer's preferred days of the week and time periods (morning or afternoon).</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							If a customer was coming to the form from the link provided by the kiosk, the form needs a "Welcome" page to connect the two.
							<ol>
								<li>It serves as a transition and sets expectations for the key duplication process.</li>
								<li>We wanted to add a Welcome page for both the web-only and kiosk-to-web customers, but we received some pushback for the former. After some discussions, we decided we would release MVP without it for the web-only flow, then consider adding it post-MVP.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>

							Adding a Welcome page to the beginning web portal form eases the customer into the flow and sets expectations.

						</figcaption>
          </figure>
					<p>We updated the designs accordingly, collected feedback to make sure the designs matched expectations, and got sign-off to begin.</p>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="development">Development: More questions added, mobile navigation compromise, and additional redesigns</h4>
					<p>
						During implementation and user acceptance testing, we found more changes to make to the form:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Ask the customer for their car color and if their car has remote start.
							<ol>
								<li>Although car color shouldn't affect the key itself, locksmiths need to collect it to verify that the car belongs to the customer requesting service.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							On mobile, convert the horizontal progress bar to a dropdown for easier implementation.
						</li>
						<li>
							On the Welcome page, add a checkbox for the customer to check after reading the list of items they will need to bring to their appointment.
							<ol>
								<li>By checking the box, the customer confirms that they understand that they will need to bring these items.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>

						We were also asked to update the price displayed on the form and kiosk and create an email to be sent when an appointment has been confirmed.
					</p>
					<p>
						While implementing all of the requested changes and gathering approval, we had spare time, so we also updated two other areas in the portal:

						<li><strong>The Vehicle Lockouts service request form.</strong> We applied the same design system as Vehicle Key Duplication for consistency.</li>
						<li><strong>The Order Status feature.</strong> Not only did we update the design system to match, but we added more granular statuses for more transparency and made the feature more mobile-friendly.</li>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to jump-to" id="results">Results: 400% increase in jobs booked for vehicle keys</h4>
          <p>
            Within two weeks of the new web form's release, the number of locksmith jobs booked for vehicle key duplication increased by 400%. Although the conversion from kiosk to web (getting customers to input their mobile number and open the form) wasn't as high as we had hoped for, the conversion from the web form was much better than expected. Therefore, we considered this project a success.
          </p>
					<p>
						We noticed that within the form, the biggest dropoff points were:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>From Car & Key to Service Location</li>
						<li>From Service Summary to Checkout</li>
						<li>From Service Location to Scheduling</li>
					</ol>
					<p>so we made a point to address these in post-MVP.</p>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="reflection">Reflection: Get outside feedback, finalize requirements before implementation</h4>
					<p>
						Considering the project scope and limitations, it went fairly smoothly. If we were to do this again, we should:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Get 1-2 paid users not affiliated with or familiar with us to go through the entire kiosk and web portal form flows and gather their feedback. The more user feedback, the better, but we need to keep budget and time constraints in mind.</li>
						<li>Finalize the requirements and list of questions with the locksmith team before implementation to reduce the number of last-minute changes.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4 class="story-chapter jump-to" id="next-steps">Next Steps</h4>
					<ol>
						<li>Get user testing for both the web portal and kiosk flows to investigate the three biggest points of dropoff.</li>
						<li>Add a Welcome page to the form for web-only customers for consistency and transparency.</li>
						<li>Plan the implementation of a unified design system across kiosk, web portal, website, email, and other touchpoints.</li>
					</ol>
