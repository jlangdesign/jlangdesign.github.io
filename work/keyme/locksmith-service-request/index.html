					<h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
					<p>
						<em>Note: Some content cannot be displayed due to the NDA.</em>
					</p>
					<p>
						Customers can duplicate a variety of vehicle keys at the KeyMe kiosk. However, some vehicle keys still require a locksmith to duplicate. This means that we have to connect those customers to locksmiths via the kiosk. Initially, the kiosk would ask the customer for their contact info to send to a locksmith. Then, the locksmith would later contact the customer to gather more details and set up an appointment. This approach was ineffective because:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Lack of info</strong> - The customer didn't know enough about the process to feel comfortable sharing their contact info.</li>
						<li><strong>Inefficient communication</strong> - Getting all of the required details required a lot of back-and-forth conversation between the locksmith and customer. Also, not all customers responded to contact. This led to frustration and unbooked jobs.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						To address these issues, we designed a flow that connects these customers to a locksmith service request form in our web portal. Instead of asking for contact info right away, the kiosk explains the process to the customer, then texts the form's link to their mobile device. The customer can then fill out the form, giving the locksmith all of the info they need to book the job. Furthermore, the form provided more info on the duplication process as the customer filled it out, which helped build trust with the customer.
					</p>
					<p>
						We completed this project in two phases:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Phase 1</strong> - We started with an unpolished, existing locksmith service request form in our web portal and completely redesigned it to improve the user experience. This form and web portal existed for customers that discovered KeyMe's vehicle key services by browsing the internet (without visiting a kiosk).</li>
						<li><strong>Phase 2</strong> - We then modified the kiosk flow to send the form instead of accepting all contact info directly. We also modified the web form slightly to improve the transition from kiosk to web, like autofilling some fields if the customer came from the kiosk and not directly from the KeyMe website. This flow benefits customers that tried duplicating their vehicle key at a KeyMe kiosk but couldn't do so because they actually needed a locksmith.</li>
					</ul>

          <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Objectives</h4>
					<p>
						We mainly wanted to increase the number of jobs booked for vehicle key duplication via kiosk. However, we also wanted to increase the number booked directly from our web portal form. From prior research on our customers, we were planning to connect the kiosk experience to the web portal experience (or something similar) so our customers would have an easier time typing. Thus, we had two objectives:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Make the service request form in our web portal easier to fill out.</li>
						<li>
							Streamline info collection for vehicle key dupliication jobs from kiosk customers.
							<ol>
								<li>We hypothesized that if the new web form was successful, we could direct kiosk customers to it instead of asking them to type the info directly into the kiosk. Personal devices are easier to type on than large kiosk screens.</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
					</ol>

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Research</h4>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">User Research</h5>
					<p>
						We couldn't interview actual customers at the time due to security concerns and financial constraints. Instead, we asked others from the organization to provide feedback on current and proposed designs from a customer's perspective. This and data from the analytics team allowed us to better understand our customers and their journeys.
					</p>

            <figcaption class="caption">
							According to our analytics team, the average kiosk customer is female, in their mid-20s to mid-40s, and going through a stressful time in their lives (like buying a house). We didn't have demographic data from our web portal users, so we used our kiosk customer persona for the web portal redesign.

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Design Research</h5>
					<p>
						Additionally, we studied precedents and design heuristics, then used those to further audit our current designs. We couldn't find examples from competitors, but we did study long, step-by-step flows from other companies.

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Ideation</h4>
					<p>
						Based on our research, we brainstormed several different options for the web portal form and kiosk experiences.
					</p>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Web Portal Form</h5>
					<p>
						Our ideation for the web portal form focused on the navigation system between steps. We explored different questions, orders of questions, and question formats as well.
					</p>
					<figure>
  	        <img src="" alt="[alt]" class="project-media">

							Examples of changes to questions and the order of questions.
						</figcaption>
          </figure>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Kiosk</h5>
					<p>
						The kiosk is more sensitive to changes and requires a longer release cycle, so we didn't explore any large layout changes - only minor changes to copy and imagery. We did consider linking to the form via a QR code on the screen vs. asking the customer for their mobile number. However, the QR code could've caused accessibility issues, and we would've had to test libraries for generating unique codes. The mobile number input was the safest choice and the lowest level of effort for the time being.

							Design variations for the second page where the kiosk directs the customer to the web portal form, either by scanning a code or entering their mobile number.
						</figcaption>
          </figure>

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Design System</h5>
					<p>
						One detail that users noted was that the kiosk's and web portal form's UIs looked very different, as if they were from different companies. We tried designs where the kiosk's more colorful design system matched the web portal form's more minimalist design system - and vice versa. However, changing the kiosk to match would've taken too long. On the other hand, changing the web portal to match would've resulted in color contrast issues. Therefore, we kept both design systems as-is for the time being.

					<h4 class="story-chapter">Results</h4>
          <p>
            Within two weeks of the new web form's release, the number of locksmith jobs booked for vehicle key duplication increased by 400%. Although the conversion from kiosk to web wasn't as high as we had hoped for, the conversion from the web form was much better than expected. Therefore, we considered this project a success.
