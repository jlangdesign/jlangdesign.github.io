	        <h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
	        <p>
	          Two of the most rewarding parts of travel are leaving one’s comfort zone and befriending locals. Unfortunately, these friendships tend to suffer after returning home. Bonding becomes difficult when friends are not physically together and are out of sight, out of mind. Text and phone conversations gradually become less frequent due to lack of engagement and time until they stop altogether. The friendships fade away as both sides become irrelevant to each other. These problems are compounded by introversion. Having to constantly initiate and continue conversations can be exhausting. After all this, one feels that international friendships are not worth the effort. With this project, I propose a tangible user interface (TUI) system that helps introverted college-aged solo travelers not only befriend locals in the countries they visit but also maintain these friendships despite cultural differences and geographical distance.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	Pidgepanion is a system of interactive media that helps introverted college-aged solo travelers not only befriend locals but maintain those friendships once they return home. It is composed of a mobile app that initializes contact prior to travel, a keychain that facilitates communication while abroad, and a lamp interface that encourages keeping in touch after returning home. By closing the physical and social distance between locals and travelers, Pidgepanion hopes to promote cultural understanding and create a world without borders.
	        </p>

	        <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Objectives</h4>
	        <p>
	        	Design a tangible UI system in response to this question:
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	How can introverted college-aged solo travelers befriend locals in the countries they visit and maintain these friendships despite cultural differences and geographic distance?
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Exploration</h4>

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Survey-Results.png" alt="List of survey results regarding respondents' interactions with locals when traveling" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Survey results</h5>
	        <p>
	        	I asked people about their personalities along with their experiences with locals abroad and internationals in their home country. Most respondents were students in the US and HK that traveled as part of their study abroad experience, as opposed to traveling purely for leisure or work. Locations visited varied, but majority were in Europe, followed by Asia and South America.

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Persona.png" alt="Persona diagram explaining Tina Tran, a quintessential Pidgepanion user" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Persona</h5>
	        <p>
						Based on the survey results, I created my persona, Tina. Tina is an introverted college student with social anxiety. Graduating in a few months and bored with her life in the US, she buys a ticket to Taiwan on a whim. In addition to experiencing a new culture, she’s hoping the trip will increase her independence and improve her social skills. Because this will be her first time in Taiwan - and also her first time traveling solo - Tina can’t help but feel overwhelmed by all the logistics she must figure out beforehand. There was a lot more to Taiwanese culture than shown in the dramas she watched. She really wants to befriend locals in Taiwan, but there seemed to be so many barriers. One, she neither speaks Mandarin nor Hokkien. She did try to pick up Mandarin, but she was never good at distinguishing tones and learning Traditional Chinese characters. Two, her social anxiety is already enough to inhibit her here, let alone in a foreign country. The thought of having to reach out to strangers terrifies her. Even if she does manage to initiate contact with a local, she’s afraid of bothering, offending, or boring them. And three, she isn’t sure she’d be able to stay good friends with them once she goes back home anyway. Along with social burnout and not knowing what to talk about, she’s concerned about time zone differences and not being able to physically hang out. The idea of making and having international friends appeals to Tina, but in the end, she isn’t sure if it’s worth all the trouble.

						The empathy map details how she feels, thinks, speaks, and acts due to her social anxiety - most of which are negative.

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Other Notes</h5>
	        <p>
						My survey indicated that lack of physicality is a major barrier to maintaining long-distance friendships, so I wanted to incorporate tangible user interfaces (TUIs) into my intervention. Therefore, most of my research was benchmarking TUIs and other tangibles. I also looked at ways mobile apps (non-TUIs) that help connect people, especially long-distance friends.
					</p>

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/As-Is.png" alt="User journey map of Tina's travel experience without Pidgepanion" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Journey Map As-Is</h5>
	        <p>
						I based the as-is mapping on my recent study abroad experience as well as the experiences described in the survey responses. By mapping out the user journey before, during, and after travel, I realized how extensive it was. That also meant there were many pain points. Before travel, Tina (the user) struggles to plan her trip because she is overwhelmed by how much she needs to learn about Taiwan. She tells herself that she’ll make an effort to befriend locals to make the experience more fulfilling.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once Tina is actually abroad though, she is overcome with culture shock. While she does interact with locals when she shops and orders food, she’s hesitant to reach out further due to social anxiety, language barriers, and fear of rejection. This leads to a feeling of isolation. To feel more comfortable socializing, she goes to more touristy areas to meet people with culture and language similar to hers.
					</p>
					<p>
						While Tina does chat with - and even befriends - a few fellow tourists, enjoys the rest of her trip, and returns home with good memories, she can’t help but feel the trip lacked something. Because she mainly engaged in touristy activities, the experience didn’t feel as personalized and authentic. She didn’t achieve her goal of befriending locals. Even the friendships she made with the tourists were weakening. The week she came home, they talked often, but communication dropped shortly after that. She wanted to keep in touch with them, but time zone differences, physical distance, and lack of common topics made that difficult. Tina resigned herself to just staring at their contacts and remembering the good times. <em>How could I even make and keep Taiwanese friends if I couldn’t even stay friends with those tourists that I shared a language and culture with?</em>
					</p>

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/To-Be.png" alt="User journey map of Tina's travel experience with Pidgepanion" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Journey Map To-Be</h5>
	        <p>
						Tina learns about the Pidgepanion service when searching for useful apps in preparation for her trip. She downloads the app, signs up for a profile, learns about Taiwanese culture, and matches with a Taiwanese college student in Tainan named Oscar. Over the next few months, they chat via the app to learn about each other. The conversation usually goes smoothly since they have a lot in common, though they also enjoy talking about the differences in their lives. Sometimes Tina isn’t sure what to talk about, but the app helps her find ways to keep the conversation going. One day, she receives a package in the mail containing the keychains and lamp. She syncs those devices to her phone and packs a keychain to give to Oscar when they meet.
					</p>
					<p>
						At the airport in Tainan, they meet for the first time in person. Oscar helps Tina settle into her hotel and lets her rest for a little before taking her to the night market. He recommends his favorite street foods to her and guides her in ordering in Mandarin as they visit each vendor. All the social interactions are starting to wear Tina down, so they sit down and slowly enjoy some coffin bread. They swap keychains as they eat. Since Tina just arrived in Taiwan and it was getting late, they decide to call it a day. Oscar asks Tina to signal when she gets back to her hotel and also let him know if she needs help with anything. Tina uses the keychain to signal her return, and Oscar acknowledges receiving the signal by responding with one of his own.
					</p>
					<p>
						They continue to hang out during the two weeks that Tina is in Tainan. Sometimes Oscar takes her to adjacent towns to explore the cultures there, but they mostly stay in Tainan to do the local activities they both tagged in the app. He helps her befriend his friends too and continues to help her communicate with other locals so she can eventually get around more independently. Though she experiences social anxiety at times, Oscar helps make her more comfortable. Oscar’s keychain and its glows reassure her that she isn’t alone and gives her confidence. The excitement she gets from the authentic experience keeps her going.
					</p>
					<p>
						When it’s time for Tina to finally leave, Oscar accompanies her to the airport, and they say their goodbyes. She fiddles with the keychain while she reflects on the experience during the flight. Upon returning, she again uses the keychain to quickly signal she made it home safely, and Oscar returns shortly after. She rests for the next few days but gets caught up in other responsibilities later. One weekend while running errands, she notices that her keychain is glowing. She smiles, remembering Oscar, and signals him back. When she gets a break, she taps the keychain to her phone to reminiscence their shared experiences. The app suggests that she try talking to him later tonight since they will both be free then. In a good mood, Tina agrees with the idea and sets a reminder.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tina gets back after a long, tiring day. She sees the lamp on her nightstand glowing to indicate Oscar is available, which puts her in a better mood. Thus, she calls him, syncing the lamp with her device in the process. The lamp reacts to the emotions in their conversation as they complain, celebrate, and chuckle about various topics in their lives. It also played sounds from the night market during her first night in Tainan - making her feel like she was right next to him again - and gave her something to fidget with as they talked to help with her anxiety. The whole time, the colors and the movement of her lamp are synced with his. It felt like they were interacting with the same object and near each other. The conversation is cut short because it’s late in the US, but both agreed that they had a good conversation and agree to talk again soon.

					<h5 class="story-subchapter">Lo-fi Prototyping + Guerilla Testing</h5>
	        <p>
						My initial idea consisted of an immersive installation at an airport that would match travelers to locals and dispense souvenirs functioning at TUIs to help maintain friendships. Therefore, I asked questions about the brand, installation, and souvenirs. Testing allowed me to realize that the brand was working, but the installation concept wasn’t. The brand colors were evocative of birds, flight, and travel, as intended. On the other hand, testers were concerned about how lengthy and last-minute the installation experience was. Not only would they be grumpy and tired after a flight, but they would also be in a rush to get to their hotel. The installation also didn’t give the traveler or the local enough time to prepare to meet each other. As for the souvenirs, testers said they wouldn’t want to carry extra baggage during their trip. Any souvenir would have to be small, though being small would limit its function.
					</p>
					<p>
						I tried really hard to avoid including a mobile app or making a mobile app central to my intervention. I wanted a tangible that could be used in conjunction with existing IM apps so users wouldn’t have to download another app to their phone. However, user feedback suggested that including a mobile app would be more practical than using an installation - they would be able to prepare much more in advance. Having an app would help keep the great amount of information needed more accessible and organized.

	        <p>
						While Pidgepanion is accessible to all, it mainly caters to introverts and those with social anxiety by using relaxed visuals, reassuring language, and gentle reminders. Users don’t feel the need to spend too much energy socializing, physically approach strangers in a foreign country, or worry about bothering friends. Basically, Pidgepanion acts as a wingman for making and keeping international friends.

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Mobile-Context.png" alt="Flow that Tina would experience in the Pidgepanion mobile app while trying to befriend a local during her travels" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">The Mobile App</h5>
	        <p>
						The app primarily helps the user prepare for their trip. When they first create their profile, they enter personal details that would help Pidgepanion find matches for them, such as personality type, languages spoken, and interests. Not all of these details would be visible to other users in order to maintain some privacy. They can also add their mailing address here so they can receive a set of customized keychains and a desk lamp before their trip. After creating a profile, the user adds details about their “journey” - or trip - that could also be used to find matches. That creates a journey page, which contains a card for each location the user listed earlier.
					</p>
					<p>
						From there, they can watch a video, read a more detailed guide, or find matches - all of which are optional. The video is a crash course in the culture of the location and told from the perspective of a local. It advises the user on how to approach locals. The guide expands upon the details presented in the video, allowing the user to take a deeper dive into learning the culture if they wish. Finally, the page of matches presents all locals that are available to hang out during their trip. They are ordered by personality, interests, and activities they are willing to do with the user, with matching attributes highlighted. The user can then take a deeper look at their profile or swipe to send a friend request.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once the local accepts the request, the user will get a notification. The local is encouraged to reach out first to make the user feel more comfortable, but the user can message them first if they would like. They can get to know each other by chatting before the trip and arrange an initial meetup once the user arrives in the country. Ideally, the local would greet the user at the airport and help them settle in. If the user struggles to keep the conversation going with the local, they can press the “hint” icon for help. This presents possible responses or conversation topics based on mutual interests and chat history.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the user returns home from their trip, they can get reminders from the app to keep in touch with their new friend every so often or suggestions for times to chat based on both of their schedules. The app also tracks the “signals” - glow notifications - they receive from their friend and allows some customization of the keychain and lamp.
					</p>

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Keychain-Context.png" alt="Different states of the Pidgepanion keychain" class="project-media">
					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Keychain-Diagrams.png" alt="Anatomy of the Pidgepanion keychain" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">The Keychain</h5>
		      <p>
						The keychain is a small, portable gadget shaped like the Pidgepanion wing. It acts as a visible, tangible reminder of the local they befriended. When the user signs up for the Pidgepanion service, they are mailed a set. Each one is customized - one side has the colors of the user’s home country’s flag, while the other side is in core brand colors with the user’s name and country engraved in it. Before they embark on the trip, the user links the keychains to their phone through the app. They then take one of the keychains along with them on the trip. When they meet with the local, they trade it for one of the local’s keychains so both parties have a souvenir from the other. During the trip, the keychains function as simple, nonverbal communication devices when they are apart. Squeezing it for a few moments sends a signal to the other person’s phone and keychain, causing the latter to glow softly. This can be used to let the other know they are okay, remind them that they’re there if they need help, or another meaning that the two parties agree on. Additionally, the user can fidget with the keychain to help with their anxiety. The local would understand that the user is anxious and try to help them out in their current situation.
					</p>
					<p>
						After returning home, the keychain can still be used. Squeezing it still signals the other person - even if they’re on the other side of the world - and it can still receive signals to glow. It’s a simple way for one person to let the other know that they’re thinking of them, even if they can’t talk at the moment. Additionally, holding the keychain to their phone when the Pidgepanion app is open brings up some shared memories with that person. These memories may be texts, pictures, or videos that were taken during the trip. Reminding the user of these good times with the local will help the them feel more connected and encourage them to continue reaching out, even if they are separated by physical distance.
					</p>

					<img loading="lazy" src="pidgepanion/Lamp-Context.png" alt="Different states and sensory outputs of the Pidgepanion desk lamp" class="project-media">
					<h5 class="story-subchapter">The Desk Lamp</h5>
		      <p>
						The desk lamp is a slightly larger physical reminder that stays at home, located in an area that would be a comfortable spot for a conversation. Like the keychain, it can receive glow signals and is shaped like the Pidgepanion wing, but it also reacts to conversations the user has with the local and physical touch. It is shipped in the same package as the keychains. The lamp has three states: idle, ready, and active. In idle state, it glows when the user receives a signal, just like the keychain. The glow gradually grows and fades repeatedly as a gentle notification that the sender is thinking of you. In ready state, it glows to indicate that the other person is available to talk. The glow color is the same as in the idle state, but it glows constantly instead of changing intensity. This state reassures the user that they wouldn’t be bothering the other person, which they may have feared doing beforehand. In active state, it actively reacts to input when the user is talking with a Pidgepanion friend, and those changes are mirrored to the other’s lamp in real time. This creates a tangible connection between the two despite distance, engages multiple senses, and adds some delight to the conversation. The lamp’s strange shape also encourages play, benefitting users that need to fidget while socializing.
					</p>
					<p>
						Types of changes:
					</p>
					<ul>
	            <li>
		            Changes color based on emotions in the conversation, which are detected via sentiment analysis.
	            </li>
	            <li>
		            Changes intensity of light based on volume of the conversation - how loud a person is speaking.
	            </li>
	            <li>
		            Temporarily darkens in spots that are touched by reacting to body heat - akin to a mood ring - allowing the other person to realize how the user is making contact with the lamp.
	            </li>
	            <li>
		            Plays environmental noise from shared memories quietly in the background to awaken nostalgia.
	            </li>
	            <li>
		            Automatically spins/moves the lamp feathers on the other person’s lamp as the user spins/moves them on their own end.
	            </li>
	        </ul>

					<p>
						This multisensory experience makes both people remember the good times they shared, feel in touch as they talk, and become aware of the positive emotions and energy they feel while communicating with each other, encouraging them to continue keeping in touch in the future.
					</p>
					<p>
						Glow colors can be customized in the app. Glow signals can also be sent via the lamp by touching a person’s keychain to the lamp for a few seconds.
