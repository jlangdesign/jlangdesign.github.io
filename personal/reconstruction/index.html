	        <h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
	        <p>
		        When historical records in Asia suddenly disappear, you are pulled into the future - year 2175 - to utilize the time travel technology to rebuild history. It’s up to you to travel around Asia, investigate portals to different time periods, and return lost artifacts to their proper places in history. If you fail to solve these mysteries, the present-day world you came from is destined to become “Nil” - a cultural desert and dystopia.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Reconstruction is a casual mission-based adventure game. The controls are simple enough for casual gamers to pick up, and the game can be played in short bursts. Missions break the game into smaller pieces, and completing missions advances the game. The player also feels a sense of adventure since they have to travel to different regions and discover portals. Most of the fun is derived from narrative and discovery.
	        </p>

	        <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Objectives</h4>
	        <p>
		        Develop a fun, original browser game with intuitive mechanics and effective gameplay.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Exploration</h4>
	        <p>

	        </p>
	        <p>
		        History is an important part of culture, but we often don't place enough emphasis on it in the education system. Even if we learn about history, we may have trouble seeing the connections between causes and events. Not appreciating history and culture can lead to cultural desertification. We thought, <em>What if we could show how the absence of history affects cultural development?</em> And thus, our concept was born!
	        </p>
	        <p>
						Because our game was based on history, it was essential for us to have a well-developed story. Therefore, we started by writing different background stories. We eventually created a story about time-traveling in Asia to return lost artifacts to their proper time periods. This way, players could explore different historical periods in Asia and learn how artifacts gave birth to various cultures. We also opted for a casual minigame-based format (instead of more fighting-based) to appeal to a wider audience. Using relatively simple and friendly-looking graphics would add to the casual feel. Both our visuals and core mechanics were inspired by the <em>Professor Layton</em>, <em>Scribblenauts</em>, and <em>Poptropica</em> games.
	        </p>
	        <p>
						We then gathered feedback by delivering a game pitch and holding playtesting sessions. Surprisingly, most playtesters understood the complex story but struggled with the simple minigames - they tended to ignore the instructions before each one. That led us to make our instructions popup more prominent and available after starting the game. We also added visual indicators of progress, such as the type or number of items to collect. A few peers found the minigames too simple - even for casual gamers - so we added extra challenges, such as harmful objects and time limits. The most interesting idea we received was to make the results of one minigame affect gameplay of subsequent minigames. For instance, the first minigame produced a basket artifact, and its quality depended on the player's performance in the minigame. The basket was strong if they followed the directions, and it had holes if they made mistakes. The next minigame required the player to catch a certain number of falling ingredients with the basket they made. The whole basket would collect the ingredients easily, while the broken basket would lose some of the ingredients it caught, making gameplay harder. Incorporating this idea added more depth to the gameplay and made the minigames feel more connected. Despite Reconstruction being a "casual" game, design and development was anything but casual!

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Results</h4>
	        <p>
		        Basically, players wander around, open portals, play minigames, collect artifacts, and return artifacts. They have some freedom in the order they do those activities. For instance, they may choose to explore a time period fully to collect all the artifacts, or they could jump back and forth between different time periods. As more regions in Asia open up, they have more freedom in the order they want to explore them in.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        The game is broken into two modes: Adventure Mode and Mission Mode. In Adventure Mode, the player can navigate the environments freely by using the mouse. They first start out in the future world, Nil, and look for suspicious glowing objects. Revealing these objects may require manipulating the environment in some way, such as opening doors or pushing other objects. Once the player finds the glowing objects, they can open portals from the objects. These portals will take them to environments in past time periods, which they can also explore. These environments are still part of Adventure Mode.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        When they enter certain areas in those past time periods, they may trigger cutscenes and enter Mission Mode. In Mission Mode, players play minigames, which can be action-based or puzzled-based. Player movement is more restricted in Mission Mode, and the missions require different mouse interactions, such as hovering, dragging, or rapid clicking. Players stay in Mission Mode until they complete or quit the minigame. Completing a minigame gets you an artifact, which is needed to advance the story. There are multiple “missions” or minigames in each time period, meaning there are multiple artifacts to collect in each portal. Sometimes, not all the missions in a given time period will be available from the start, but they will be unlocked as more artifacts are collected and returned. This means that the player may have to backtrack to certain time periods periodically to complete the game.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Once the player acquires a new artifact, they can return to Nil and have the artifact examined. This will unlock new regions in Asia to investigate and open portals in. The players can then open their map to go to these new regions and look for the correct time period to return the artifact to. Returning an artifact to its proper place in history will trigger more cutscenes, which may trigger minigames and create more opportunities to earn artifacts. Initially, players can only explore 1950s Hong Kong, but as the game progresses, more and more of Asia will open up to them.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Throughout the whole game, the player will alternate between the Adventure and Mission Modes. Over time, Nil will gradually become more colorful and lively - more human - as more and more artifacts are returned.
