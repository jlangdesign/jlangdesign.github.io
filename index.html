            Hey there! I'm Jasmine, an end-to-end product/UX designer who also does user research, front-end development, and game design. I built this portfolio from scratch so I could continue honing my design and development skills, especially in accessibility. A few tidbits about my experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>📦 Products I've designed</strong>: Mainly responsive web apps (internal and consumer-facing), native iOS/Android mobile apps, and emails. I've also dabbled in kiosk interfaces, packaging/print, and digital ads.</li>
            <li><strong>💼 Fields I've worked in</strong>: B2B/SaaS, B2C, B2B2C - mainly in startup environments.</li>
            <li><strong>🛠️ My toolbox</strong>: Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects</li>
            <li><strong>🌱 Currently studying</strong>: Accessibility and full-stack development</strong></li>
            <li><strong>❤️ Other things I find fun</strong>: Gaming, reading, cooking, and learning languages :D</li>
