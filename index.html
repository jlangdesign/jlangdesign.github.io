            Hey there! I'm Jasmine, an end-to-end product UX designer who also
            does user research, front-end development, and game design. I built
            this portfolio from scratch so I could continue honing my design and
            development skills, especially in accessibility. A few tidbits about
            my experience:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>📦 Products I've designed</strong>: Mainly responsive web
              apps (internal and consumer-facing), native iOS/Android mobile
              apps, and emails. I've also dabbled in kiosk interfaces,
              packaging/print, and digital ads.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>💼 Fields I've worked in</strong>: B2B/SaaS, B2C, B2B2C -
              mainly in startup environments.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>🛠️ My toolbox</strong>: Figma, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
              React, Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>🌱 Currently studying</strong>: Accessibility and
              full-stack development
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>❤️ Other things I find fun</strong>: Gaming, reading,
              cooking, and learning languages :D
