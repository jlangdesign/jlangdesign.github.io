        <h1 class="project-name">What I do as a UX/UI Designer</h1>
        <p>
          This page was inspired by a friend of a friend that wanted to get into UX/UI and asked about my experience. It was also inspired by everyone else that asks me, <em>"UX/UI design? What's that?"</em> and <em>"What do you even do?".</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Please keep in mind that I am only one designer, and the experiences of others may vary. Happy reading!
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section">Summary</h2>
        <p>
          I design (or redesign) features in mobile and web apps so they are clearer and more pleasant to use. Most of my time is spent:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Doing user research to understand issues</li>
          <li>Wireframing new app flows and UIs</li>
          <li>Linking wireframes into clickable prototypes to do user testing and get feedback</li>
          <li>Preparing projects to hand off to developers</li>
          <li>Review app builds to ensure that they match the designs (QA)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I use <strong>Figma</strong> for pretty much all of my main UX/UI responsibilities (user research/testing, wireframing, prototyping).
        </p>
        <p>
          The responsibilities above are pretty standard for UX/UI designer roles, and Figma is one of the most popular UX/UI design tools too. Many employers also list basic HTML/CSS knowledge as a bonus. Learning these skills is a great way to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of this page explains these points in detail - as well as my other responsibilities and tools - but you don’t need to read those unless you <em>really, really</em> want to.
        </p>

        <h2 class="story-section">What I use</h2>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Figma for ideating, wireframing, prototyping, conducting user testing, developer handoff, and maintaining design systems
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>It’s great for sharing designs with others - just share a link instead of a whole file - and providing devs with design specs.</li>
          <li>Other common software used for this include Sketch, Adobe XD, InVision, and maybe Principal.</li>
          <li>I've also heard of some using Adobe Illustrator for wireframing, but it's not optimized for that like the software above.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Adobe Illustrator for creating more complex graphics in the UI (or even for marketing)
        </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Figma (and some of the other wireframing tools mentioned above) do have basic vector drawing tools, but you will probably want to use Adobe Illustrator for anything fancy.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Adobe After Effects for creating animations to use in prototyping and handing off to developers
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>After Effects can be used to simulate interactions in prototypes or produce animations to hand off to the devs for the final product (e.g. a confetti animation on a success screen). Exporting animations from After Effects vs. asking devs to program an animation from scratch can save a lot of time.</li>
          <li>To create animations that devs can add to the app, use the Bodymovin extension in After Effects to export the animations as JSON. They can then add them as code using the Lottie library. This method keeps file sizes small, and animations are scalable, easier to manipulate, and usable on any platform.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          HTML, CSS, JS (React JS) for front-end web development
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>React JS is a JavaScript library that simplifies the process of developing UIs by allowing developers to create reusable custom UI components.</li>
          <li>Other popular JavaScript libraries for building UIs include Vue and Angular.</li>
          <li>Many employers list HTML/CSS as a bonus, while a few also appreciate JS along with those two.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Asana for project management and handoff to developers
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Asana isn't really a UX/UI tool,  but it makes it easy to gather and give feedback on designs plus hand off projects to developers. Just use the project management tool that you like the most.</li>
          <li>You will also likely be juggling multiple projects at a time, all in different states, so project management software helps you prioritize what to work on.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Google Drive for organizing design assets, ideation session notes, research, presentations, etc.
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can use Google Docs and Sheets for typing up long notes or analyzing quantitive data, all with formatting options to make documents easier to read.</li>
          <li>Google Slides allows you to present research insights and new features to both internal teams and external stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Material Design (Android) and Human Interface Guidelines (iOS) to set design standards
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>If you are a UX/UI designer, you will likely be designing for mobile platforms. Knowing the standards of each - and the differences between both - will keep your apps' UI consistent with each platform's UI.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          ActiveCampaign and Mailchimp for email marketing and reaching out to users to do user research
        </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You don't need to use email marketing tools for reaching out to users, but they do make it easier to design and send nice emails en masse. And sometimes, nice emails can entice users to respond to you.</li>
            <li>For instance, if I am trying to feedback on a new design, I can style the email to introduce the feature, explain how it would help them, and add eye-catching buttons (or images) for them to click on and give feedback.</li>
          </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Postman for testing endpoints
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Postman comes in handy when I am setting up projects for developers, quickly creating dummy data, and checking for bugs.</li>
          <li>I test the endpoints to see how the data is being returned, then add that info to the projects. If anything is missing or not returned correctly, I let backend developers know. That way, we have all the data needed to render the designs correctly.</li>
          <li>You may also want to create dummy data for front-end developers to use for testing. Let's say that you are building a view that displays all of a user's notes, but the UI for creating a note isn't done yet, so there are no notes to work with yet. You can create notes by making API requests. Then the developers can design the notes and test their designs without having to wait until the note creation UI is done. It's nice to be able to test all throughout the product development process with dynamic (not hardcoded) data instead of waiting until the end.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="story-chapter">
          Typeform for gathering user feedback
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use survey tools like Typeform to do user research. Users can tell you more about their current pain points and give feedback on ideas or designs. You can use the responses to determine which users to follow up with for further discussions.</li>
        </ul>
