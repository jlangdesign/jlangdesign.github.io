# Jasmine Lang [UX/UI Designer + Front-end Developer]

Hey there! This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio website, which features my work in UX/UI design, web development, and game design. It's also a way for me to learn responsive web design, so I'll be updating this repo periodically. You can view the website at [jlangdesign.github.io](https://jlangdesign.github.io).

Want to get in touch? Email me at [langxjasmine@gmail.com](mailto:langxjasmine@gmail.com)!

[You can also view my CV](https://jlangdesign.github.io/assets/cv-resume.pdf).

Note: The website should work on most laptop/desktop displays, but it's not fully optimized for smaller devices yet.
