# Jasmine Lang [Product/UX Designer + Front-end Developer]

Hey there! This is my portfolio of work in product/UX design, web development, and game design. It's also a way for me to learn responsive web design and other best practices, so I'll be updating this repo periodically. You can view the website at [jlangdesign.github.io](https://jlangdesign.github.io).

Want to get in touch? Email me at [langxjasmine@gmail.com](mailto:langxjasmine@gmail.com)!

[You can also view my CV](https://jlangdesign.github.io/homepage/cv-resume.pdf).

Note: The website should work on most laptop/desktop displays, but it's not fully optimized for smaller devices yet.
