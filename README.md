# Jasmine Lang [Graphic + Interaction Designer]

## Introduction

Hi there! This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio website, which features my work in graphic design and interaction design. It's also a way for me to learn responsive web design, so I'll be updating this repo periodically. You can view the website at [jlangdesign.github.io](https://jlangdesign.github.io).
