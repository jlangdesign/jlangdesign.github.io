# Jasmine Lang [Graphic + Interaction Designer]

Hi there! This is the GitHub repo for my portfolio website, which features my work in graphic design and interaction design. It's also a way for me to learn responsive web design, so I'll be updating this repo periodically. You can view the website at [jlangdesign.github.io](https://jlangdesign.github.io).

Want to get in touch? Email me at [jlang2@ncsu.edu](mailto:jlang2@ncsu.edu)!

You can view my CV [ here](https://jlangdesign.github.io/assets/cv-resume.pdf).
