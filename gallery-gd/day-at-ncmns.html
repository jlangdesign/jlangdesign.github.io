            <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
            <p>
                A Day at the NCMNS is a rebranding project designed to promote inclusiveness of those with disabilities. It consists of a series of interactive posters, a series of bus boards, and a projection. Each of these materials shows children of differing ability levels having fun at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS). I was in charge of storyboarding the projection. In this projection, a group of children of varying abilities/disabilities at the museum work together to remove a disability label - a stigma - from another disabled child and invite him/her to join them for a fun outing at the museum. It would then end with an empowering message, such as “We’re all different, but we’re all awesome in our own way!” and the museum’s new slogan. This would encourage all members of the community - especially children - to help erase the stigma of disability and include others that are feeling left out. It would also depict the NCMNS as a place that everyone can have fun
at. The characters, settings, and messages could be switched around to make different versions of the projection. It would be displayed on walls of buildings in various parts of NC (or maybe in other parts of the country?) to reach a broader audience.

            <h1 class="story-section">Process</h1>

            <h1 class="story-chapter">Mission</h1>
            <p>
            Create a collection of promotional materials that rebrand the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences (NCMNS) as an inclusive environment and promote awareness of disability and inclusion in the general public.

            <p>
            For our promotional materials, we decided that we wanted our audience to be children because they compose the largest percentage of visitors at the NCMNS. To make these appealing to children, we chose to go with a cartoonish, kiddy style, where all the elements are cutouts from construction paper. Each character we designed would have a different personality and disability of varying visibility and permanence so disabled people would be more likely to find someone they could relate to. For instance, we have kids with more “obvious” disabilities (such as
wheelchair-bound or visually impaired), but we also have an autistic child with a small stimming necklace and a child with a broken arm.
These kids would appear in all of our pieces to tie them together.
            </p>
            <p>
            We divided up the labor and then entered production mode. First, we composed mood boards of imagery associated with disability, inclusiveness, senses, and changing perspectives. I then used that to brainstorm a story for my projection. Initial ideas included ISOTYPE disability icons morphing into people that blended in with the non-disabled and playing with figure-ground relationships in typography (e.g. a word could read as "blind" or "abled" depending on how you looked at it, like an optical illusion). Eventually, I decided it would be more powerful to show people actively fighting to end discrimination against the disabled. The storyboard would show someone ripping a "disabled" label away to reveal a person underneath. This would convey to viewers that disabled people are human too and that we must throw away our old preconceptions of the disabled.
            </p>

            <h1 class="story-chapter">Results</h1>
            <p>
            The final storyboard depicts a group of children - disabled and non-disabled - going on an outing at the NCMNS. As they are about to go into the museum, they notice a large label with a disability icon on it. Working together, the kids peel the label away to reveal another disabled kid. The kid is reluctant to go into the museum because they have faced discrimination before for being disabled and have had difficulty navigating other areas due to their disability. However, the group of kids convinces the new kid to join them on their adventure. The last scene is of them having fun together inside of the museum. Then it fades out to a positive message encouraging ablism and acceptance of diversity. Ideally, there would be a set of backgrounds, characters, disability icon labels, and messages that could be swapped around to make variations of the projection.
            </p>
            <p>
            Along with the projection, we also designed busboards and interactive posters. The busboards feature the children being mobile (like a bus) and running towards the museum with animals from said museum. The posters depict children exploring different exhibits associated with the museum. Each poster would have velcro pads on it and a basket under it containing all the paper children, and people could mix and match the children stuck to each poster - they could place a character representing themselves in the scene.
