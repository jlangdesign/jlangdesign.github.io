        <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
        <p>
	        When historical records in Asia suddenly disappear, you are pulled into the future - year 2175 - to utilize the time travel technology to rebuild history. It’s up to you to travel around Asia, investigate portals to different time periods, and return lost artifacts to their proper places in history. If you fail to solve these mysteries, the present-day world you came from is destined to become “Nil” - a cultural desert and dystopia.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Reconstruction is a casual mission-based adventure game. The controls are simple enough for casual gamers to pick up, and the game can be played in short bursts. Missions break the game into smaller pieces, and completing missions advances the game. The player also feels a sense of adventure since they have to travel to different regions and discover portals. Most of the fun is derived from narrative and discovery.

        <h1 class="story-chapter">Results</h1>

        <p>
	        Basically, players wander around, open portals, play minigames, collect artifacts, and return artifacts. They have some freedom in the order they do those activities. For instance, they may choose to explore a time period fully to collect all the artifacts, or they could jump back and forth between different time periods. As more regions in Asia open up, they have more freedom in the order they want to explore them in.
        </p>
        <p>
	        The game is broken into two modes: Adventure Mode and Mission Mode. In Adventure Mode, the player can navigate the environments freely by using the mouse. They first start out in the future world, Nil, and look for suspicious glowing objects. Revealing these objects may require manipulating the environment in some way, such as opening doors or pushing other objects. Once the player finds the glowing objects, they can open portals from the objects. These portals will take them to environments in past time periods, which they can also explore. These environments are still part of Adventure Mode.
        </p>
        <p>
	        When they enter certain areas in those past time periods, they may trigger cutscenes and enter Mission Mode. In Mission Mode, players play minigames, which can be action-based or puzzled-based. Player movement is more restricted in Mission Mode, and the missions require different mouse interactions, such as hovering, dragging, or rapid clicking. Players stay in Mission Mode until they complete or quit the minigame. Completing a minigame gets you an artifact, which is needed to advance the story. There are multiple “missions” or minigames in each time period, meaning there are multiple artifacts to collect in each portal. Sometimes, not all the missions in a given time period will be available from the start, but they will be unlocked as more artifacts are collected and returned. This means that the player may have to backtrack to certain time periods periodically to complete the game.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Once the player acquires a new artifact, they can return to Nil and have the artifact examined. This will unlock new regions in Asia to investigate and open portals in. The players can then open their map to go to these new regions and look for the correct time period to return the artifact to. Returning an artifact to its proper place in history will trigger more cutscenes, which may trigger minigames and create more opportunities to earn artifacts. Initially, players can only explore 1950s Hong Kong, but as the game progresses, more and more of Asia will open up to them.
        </p>
        <p>
	        Throughout the whole game, the player will alternate between the Adventure and Mission Modes. Over time, Nil will gradually become more colorful and lively - more human - as more and more artifacts are returned.
