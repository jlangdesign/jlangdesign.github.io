	        <h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
	        <p>
	          ARE3 is a hypothetical conference that aims to educate the public on augmented reality's spectrum of uses in three branches - education, entertainment, and expression. This year, experts will discuss applications in medical, spatial, gaming, live events, and music. The talks are supplemented by print, tablet, and mobile catalogs of the event.
	        </p>

	        <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>
	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Mission</h4>
	        <p>
	          Conduct research on experts on augmented reality (AR), who will be speakers at a hypothetical conference. Create a modern catalog (that utilizes a grid structure) about this conference and its speakers. Then convert the print version into a tablet version and mobile version, exploring affordances of electronic devices.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Playthrough</h4>
	        <p>
	          Of course, my project began with research on AR because I wasn't very educated about the topic. Pretty much the only exposure I had to it was Pok√©mon Go. You mainly hear AR being used for entertainment, but I learned that there was more to it than that. It could be used in schools or to make quick prototypes, among other applications. That discovery made me want to capture the spectrum of uses, from technical to artistic.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          When composing the print booklet, I made sure to use modern, tech-y colors and lots of imagery, for AR is futuristic, innovative, and visual-based. There also needed to be many layers to emulate how AR is layered over reality, so I experimented with transparency throughout. The logo - ARE3 - reflects multiple themes of the book. It uses exponents, which are commonly associated with math and technology, contains layers of hierarchies as well, and reaches into the distance - the future.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          With the digital versions, I was able to create an atmosphere instead of a surface. The ideas of layering and depth were more evident here. Objects receded, popped out, faded away, etc. Because not everything was going to be on the screen at any given point, there were many parts and animations to manage. I tried using a variety of gestures/interactions, some of which deviated from general expectations.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Results</h4>
	        <p>
	          The idea of a spectrum is continuously reiterated through the yellow line in the middle and each of the different sections - medical, spatial, gaming, live events, and music - branching off of the line. Each speaker is given two spreads. The first spread is dedicated entirely to providing a preview or overview of AR in their field through a collage of imagery. In the middle is an aspirational phrase about the topic. The second spread also contains some imagery, but it's primarily dedicated to an article with a short bio at the end.
	        </p>

	        <p>
	          With the tablet version, the "book" opens with an animating sequence depicting the layers of the logo separating in space. This time, the E emphasizes the spectrum as it depicts each category branching out from it. Long-pressing a section give you a quick preview of the material. Spreading the preview open with two fingers allows you to get to the article and take a deeper look. Contrary to the print booklet, elements aren't arranged according to a grid here. Being able to drag elements around makes it even more freeform. To swap to a different section, you would go to the navigation bar on the top and drag and drop a section over the yellow bar of your current section. I would say the iPad version was my more experimental version.
	        </p>

	        <p>
	          Because it's a phone, you expect things to be quicker. Therefore, animations are sped up or simplified compared to the iPad version. Long-pressing gives a more in-depth preview this time. You only need one finger to open the full article. It's easier to navigate to other sections as well just with a flick of a finger. A search and find function reduces scrolling by allowing you to find the content you need. And there are top, bottom, and side navigation bars to easily get to a different section no matter where you are. This version was more like a standard phone app, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.
