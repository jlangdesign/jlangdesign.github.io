            <p>
            bu-DONG! is an educational stacking game for kids designed to improve physical, cognitive, and social skills. They gain fine motor skills and a better understanding of physics from carefully stacking the cards, use critical thinking skills to answer the variety of questions (define, fill in the blank, arithmetic, etc.), and learn to work in teams.

            <p>
            Conduct research on a certain company and design a "board game" based on our research. The game has to have a visual identity and help students memorize facts about the company with flash cards.

            I had the task of researching Barnes & Noble, a large chain of bookstores in the United States. Through reading numerous articles, I learned that the bookseller was trying to reinvent itself in order to recover from its rapidly declining sales. It seemed that one of its more successful attempts at attracting customers involved making kids its target demographic. Thus, I decided a board game for elementary school kids would be fitting.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next step was to do research on games for kids and how they affected children's development. I noticed that games could improve eye-hand coordination and dexterity; strengthen basic skills such as reading, counting, and grouping; and teach cooperation and taking turns. Because I wanted the game to improve a variety of skills, I decided that a stacking game - or a 3D "board" game - would be appropriate.
            </p>
            <p>
            I then worked on developing prototypes involving structures you had to balance. I wanted the flashcards to double as the game pieces, but it took quite a few iterations to find a suitable shape. My initial idea was essentially questions printed on Jenga blocks, but that seemed too expensive and impractical. My next iteration involved attaching flatter pieces to an upright pole, but it was too difficult to attach them without knocking the pole over. Then I tried making slotted modular cubes, but the text did not fit on them very well. I finally decided that flat slotted modules would be best. Hexagons seemed like a fun, non-traditional shape for board games, so I used that hexagons in the flashcards and stacking base.
            </p>
            <p>
            While prototyping, I did a lot of logo and brand exploration. A lot of the children's games I studied had thick lettering and bubble letters, so I incorporated those elements too. When trying to think of a name that expressed the stacking and falling nature of the game, I stumbled upon "bu-DONG!". bu-DONG! is the romanization of the Mandarin phrase “不懂!,” which means “[I] don’t understand!” My Chinese professor pointed out that it sounded like a frog jumping into the water. I thought it also sounded like something falling and hitting the ground, which would be appropriate. The fact that the phrase has to do with “understanding” is also relevant to my game, which is about trivia and critical thinking. I further emphasized the theme of collapsing by making the counterspaces in the logo fall out of their respective letters. The red and yellow also reflect the name's Chinese origins.

            I ended up with a competitive turn-based stacking game with bright, fun visuals and kid-friendly language. Each flashcard has a red (question) side and a yellow (answer) side. Answering the question correctly allows you to form a unit of your team color and add it to the structure on the base. To win, you want to have as many of your units on the structure as you can. However, you also have to understand physics and know where to place your card, or else you may make the structure collapse and end up losing the game. More detailed instructions on how to play can be found in the "PDF of flashcards" link in the "Links" section below. The white cards tell you how to play the game, but they are not used in the actual stacking themselves.

            “With bu-DONG!, test your knowledge of Barnes & Noble trivia with your friends! Compete to build a cool structure with as many of your pieces as you can! Improve your critical thinking and physical skills! But don't be the one that makes the structure fall. Ages 6 and up.”
