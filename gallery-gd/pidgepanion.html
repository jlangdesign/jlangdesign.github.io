            <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
            <p>
              Two of the most rewarding parts of travel are leaving one’s comfort zone and interacting with locals. Unfortunately for many, that experience ends once they return home. Social media interactions with international friends are superficial at best. Text and phone conversations gradually become less frequent because of lack of engagement and time until they stop altogether. The friendships fade away as both sides become irrelevant to each other. These problems are further compounded by introversion. Having to constantly initiate interactions and keep conversations going can be exhausting, causing one to wonder if these friendships are worth the trouble. With this project, I propose a tangible user interface (TUI) system that helps introverted college-aged solo travelers not only befriend locals in the countries they visit but also maintain these friendships despite cultural differences and geographical distance.
            </p>
            <p>
            Pidgepanion is a system of interactive media that helps introverted college-aged solo travelers not only befriend locals but maintain those friendships once they return home. It is composed of a mobile app that initializes contact prior to travel, a keychain that facilitates communication while abroad, and a lamp interface that encourages keeping in touch after returning home. By closing the physical and social distance between locals and travelers, Pidgepanion hopes to promote cultural understanding and create a world without borders.

						<h1 class="story-subchapter">Survey results</h1>
            <p>
            I asked people about their personalities along with their experiences with locals abroad and internationals in their home country. Most respondents were students in the US and HK that traveled as part of their study abroad experience, as opposed to traveling purely for leisure or work. Locations visited varied, but majority were in Europe, followed by Asia and South America.

						<h1 class="story-subchapter">Persona</h1>
            <p>
							Based on the survey results, I created my persona, Tina. Tina is an introverted college student with social anxiety. Graduating in a few months and bored with her life in the US, she buys a ticket to Taiwan on a whim. In addition to experiencing a new culture, she’s hoping the trip will increase her independence and improve her social skills. Because this will be her first time in Taiwan - and also her first time traveling solo - Tina can’t help but feel overwhelmed by all the logistics she must figure out beforehand. There was a lot more to Taiwanese culture than shown in the dramas she watched. She really wants to befriend locals in Taiwan, but there seemed to be so many barriers. One, she neither speaks Mandarin nor Hokkien. She did try to pick up Mandarin, but she was never good at distinguishing tones and learning Traditional Chinese characters. Two, her social anxiety is already enough to inhibit her here, let alone in a foreign country. The thought of having to reach out to strangers terrifies her. Even if she does manage to initiate contact with a local, she’s afraid of bothering, offending, or boring them. And three, she isn’t sure she’d be able to stay good friends with them once she goes back home anyway. Along with social burnout and not knowing what to talk about, she’s concerned about time zone differences and not being able to physically hang out. The idea of making and having international friends appeals to Tina, but in the end, she isn’t sure if it’s worth all the trouble.

							The empathy map details how she feels, thinks, speaks, and acts due to her social anxiety - most of which are negative.

						<h1 class="story-subchapter">Other Notes</h1>
            <p>
							My survey indicated that lack of physicality is a major barrier to maintaining long-distance friendships, so I wanted to incorporate tangible user interfaces (TUIs) into my intervention. Therefore, most of my research was benchmarking TUIs and other tangibles. I also looked at ways mobile apps (non-TUIs) that help connect people, especially long-distance friends.
						</p>

						<img src="../gallery-img/pidgepanion/As-Is.png" class="project-pics">
						<h1 class="story-subchapter">Journey Map As-Is</h1>
            <p>
							I based the as-is mapping on my recent study abroad experience as well as the experiences described in the survey responses. By mapping out the user journey before, during, and after travel, I realized how extensive it was. That also meant there were many pain points. Before travel, Tina (the user) struggles to plan her trip because she is overwhelmed by how much she needs to learn about Taiwan. She tells herself that she’ll make an effort to befriend locals to make the experience more fulfilling.
						</p>
						<p>
							Once Tina is actually abroad though, she is overcome with culture shock. While she does interact with locals when she shops and orders food, she’s hesitant to reach out further due to social anxiety, language barriers, and fear of rejection. This leads to a feeling of isolation. To feel more comfortable socializing, she goes to more touristy areas to meet people with culture and language similar to hers.
						</p>
						<p>
							While Tina does chat with - and even befriends - a few fellow tourists, enjoys the rest of her trip, and returns home with good memories, she can’t help but feel the trip lacked something. Because she mainly engaged in touristy activities, the experience didn’t feel as personalized and authentic. She didn’t achieve her goal of befriending locals. Even the friendships she made with the tourists were weakening. The week she came home, they talked often, but communication dropped shortly after that. She wanted to keep in touch with them, but time zone differences, physical distance, and lack of common topics made that difficult. Tina resigned herself to just staring at their contacts and remembering the good times. <i>How could I even make and keep Taiwanese friends if I couldn’t even stay friends with those tourists that I shared a language and culture with?</i>

						<h1 class="story-subchapter">Lo-fi Prototyping + Guerilla Testing</h1>
            <p>
							My initial idea consisted of an immersive installation at an airport that would match travelers to locals and dispense souvenirs functioning at TUIs to help maintain friendships. Therefore, I asked questions about the brand, installation, and souvenirs. Testing allowed me to realize that the brand was working, but the installation concept wasn’t. The brand colors were evocative of birds, flight, and travel, as intended. On the other hand, testers were concerned about how lengthy and last-minute the installation experience was. Not only would they be grumpy and tired after a flight, but they would also be in a rush to get to their hotel. The installation also didn’t give the traveler or the local enough time to prepare to meet each other. As for the souvenirs, testers said they wouldn’t want to carry extra baggage during their trip. Any souvenir would have to be small, though being small would limit its function.
						</p>
						<p>
							I tried really hard to avoid including a mobile app or making a mobile app central to my intervention. I wanted a tangible that could be used in conjunction with existing IM apps so users wouldn’t have to download another app to their phone. However, user feedback suggested that including a mobile app would be more practical than using an installation - they would be able to prepare much more in advance. Having an app would help keep the great amount of information needed more accessible and organized.

							While Pidgepanion is accessible to all, it mainly caters to introverts and those with social anxiety by using relaxed visuals, reassuring language, and gentle reminders. Users don’t feel the need to spend too much energy socializing, physically approach strangers in a foreign country, or worry about bothering friends. Basically, Pidgepanion acts as a wingman for making and keeping international friends.
