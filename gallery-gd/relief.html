            <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
            <p>
            Relief is a design intervention designed to make data about student stress levels easily accessible to professors and administrators at universities. It would raise awareness of and open the door to more open conversation about (students') mental health.

            Propose a design intervention for North Carolina State University that uses data visualization to change behavior and/or perspective.

            <p>
            It was the end of the semester, and our anxiety levels were skyrocketing. Naturally, our first inclination was to design an intervention to help students manage stress levels. But then we realized that not knowing how to manage stress wasn't always the problem - it was more like we had too much work to manage. Therefore, we decided that our intervention should target people of authority at universities, such as professors and administrators. It should somehow communicate students' stress levels to faculty so they can better understand their students and provide the support they need.
            </p>
            <p>
            We realized that we didn't know that much about faculty life, so we interviewed a few members. That's when we learned that some faculty do more than teach and also deal with high levels of stress. For example, one of our professors spent more time doing research and writing than teaching. An administrator we spoke to also took work home on the weekends. Schedules varied greatly from person to person, but we noticed that most faculty members depended on their calendar every day. The types of devices they would use to check their calendar and perform work-related duties varied as well, meaning we would need multiple touchpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
            We also needed to do research on how to collect and deliver such sensitive data in an unobtrusive manner. Precedents for collecting data on stress levels included face-trackers, questionnaires with scales, and automatic sensing apps with data on trends - we drew some inspiration from all three. Then we developed the visualizations, which were inspired by Rainmeter desktop displays. We wanted to display current stress levels as well as stress levels over time (trends). Being able to see patterns would allow faculty to predict stress levels and adjust or intervene as needed in advance. However, we had to simplify them to avoid overwhelming students and faculty alike and encourage sustained use.

            <p>
            Our intervention is a multi-platform app that collects student stress level data quickly, easily, and anonymously. It begins with the students, who are prompted on their mobile devices to choose professors to share data with. Every day, the student can relay this information by opening the app and pushing a slider along a scale (1-100) to a value commensurate with their current stress level. Then the app sends the data and gives the student a tip for the day. We chose not to have the app ask more personal questions because students may not be comfortable sharing too many details (and professors may not be comfortable knowing too many details as well).
            </p>
            <p>
            Professors can view the data on their desktops, which they use daily as part of work. Relief sends them a notification synced through their calendar application. That way, they will remember to check stress levels every morning before classes and as they work. All they will be able to see is an aggregate (not individual submissions) of their students' stress levels at the moment and how many students have submitted. This data can be divided by class or section so the professor knows which students to focus on. They can also see data from other departments in their college and campus-wide as well as trends. Professors can also view the data through smart watches. We opted not to have a mobile app because some of the faculty we spoke to did not always have their phone on them or check their phone while at work (whereas the computer and smart watches were consistently present).
            </p>
            <p>
            The final part of the intervention is a collection of installations around campus. Here, information about student stress-levels campus-wide is collected and displayed for the whole campus to view. Information is gathered through simple gestures rather than electronic devices - a thumbs up inputs a stress level of 0 (low level), a flat hand (so-so) inputs 50, and a thumbs down inputs 100 (high level). While it doesn't separate responses based on individual students, the installation is less anonymous because other students will be able to see you making gestures conveying your general mood. However, being able to see each others' gestures can lead to more open discussion about mental health.
