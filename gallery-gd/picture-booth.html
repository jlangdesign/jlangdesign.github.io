		      <h1 class="story-section" id="overview">Overview</h1>
		      <p>
		        Picture Booth is a photo-printing installation in airports that raises public awareness about dementia. It educates users about the condition and urges them to spend more time with their family, which could offset or potentially
						help prevent dementia. First, the user uploads a photo from their travel to print. While the photo is printing, the user is invited to watch a short video about dementia. The photo then prints in the form of a two-way postcard, giving a chance for the user to write a message to their family and (re)connect with them.
		      </p>
		      <p>
			      In short, Picture Booth aims to:
		      </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Raise public awareness towards dementia.</li>
		        <li>Encourage people to spend more time with their families.</li>
		        <li>Create a happy, meaningful moment within families.</li>
		      </ol>
		      <br>

		      <p>
			      Design a public installation to raise awareness of, generate empathy for, and urge for action towards a global issue. The installation is located in Hong Kong and is designed for tourists.

			      When people are busy having fun in a different country, it can be easy for them to forget about their families in their home country, especially if they have already moved out of their parents' home. This can make their parents depressed and potentially increase their chance of developing dementia. We wanted to encourage young people to reach out to their aging parents as a first step in fighting dementia. This meant our design would have to both generate empathy and educate these young internationals to compel them to act. Because we were focusing on tourists, we wanted postcards to be a main component because of their portability and sentimental value.
		      </p>
		      <p>
						To better understand our target users and generate ideas, we conducted a few participatory design workshops with international students of different cultures. We had them play memory games, watch different videos about dementia, and discuss what they would like to say to their families. These gave us ideas on how to simulate dementia, appeal to emotions, and add substance to the postcards. For instance, participants intially thought the tasks would be easy, but then they struggled to carry them out. These unexpected challenges led to them getting frustrated, much like what those with dementia experience. Our particpants felt the videos were more educational but less engaging than the games. We also realized that some aren't close enough with their family to say "I love you" or other emotionally strong words in person.
		      </p>
		      <p>
						With this new information, we mapped the installation flow. Our machine would appear to be a free photo printer at the airport to encourage tourists to use it. They would first upload the photo they want to print. While waiting for it to process, they would watch a sad, educational video about dementia to appeal to their emotions. Then they would play a simple memory game relating to the video's contents and become frustrated that they couldn't perform simple tasks, generating empathy for dementia. Finally, they would receive the photo - in postcard form - so they can reconnect with their aging parents and make a difference. The process would have to be long enough for users to reflect on the experience but short enough to keep them from quitting halfway through.

		      <p>
			      Picture Booth turns your travel photos into a learning opportunity and a chance to connect with your family. Its free photo-printing service and bright colors draw the tourist (the user) in. First, the user uploads a photo that they would like to print. Then, as the photo is printing, they watch a documentary about dementia and play a game related to the documentary. The realistic documentary introduces the topic and triggers the user's emotions, while the game simulates memory loss from dementia (to an extent). Both activities let the user know that they can still help those with dementia, despite the lack of a cure. Once the user has learned how it feels to be a caretaker and a dementia patient, the photo is printed out as a two-way postcard. Finally, the user can then write a message to their loved ones, send the postcard to them, and reflect on the experience while waiting for their flight. This postcard acts as the first step in re-connecting adults and their elderly parents, which would help fight dementia.

			      Detailed flow:
		      </p>
		      <ol>
		        <li>Welcome the users and introduce it as a free photo printing booth.</li>
		        <li>Show the printing steps + privacy policy statement.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The user uploads a photo from their phone to the machine wirelessly.
		          </p>
		        <li>Show that the photo from the phone is being received by the machine.</li>
		        <li>Show that the photo is being processed.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            (Inform them they can enjoy a short video while waiting.)
		          </p>
		        <li>Play a short documentary.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            It is an emotional documentary of a man struggling to care for his mother, who had dementia. The user can see how stressful it is. Despite the fact that there is no cure for dementia, the video urges people to help by taking care of their aging relatives.
		          </p>
		        <li>Start a short game.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The user plays a short memory game related to the video’s contents after watching the video. Each question asks the user to correctly recall a specific detail from the video (e.g. What color was the man’s hat?). These questions were meant to catch the user off-guard, since they probably don’t remember these small details.
		          </p>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            After the game, Picture Booth explains that the struggle they just experienced - trying to remember simple details - is what those with dementia suffer from every day.
		          </p>
		        <li>Receive the photo, which has been turned into a two-way postcard.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The user should be surprised to see that their photo is now a postcard.
		          </p>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            Both sides of the paper are split into two parts. The front has the photo on the left half and a word search on the right. The back has two sections for writing messages and addresses - one to send, and one to receive in response.
		          </p>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The machine then gives instructions for using the postcard and tells them to go to the back of the installation (where there is a counter and pens) to begin writing. There are also instructions on the back of the installation.
		          </p>
		        <li>Write the message.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The users write their message on the half that is behind the photo. The other half (behind the word search) is left blank for the recipients to reply with.
		          </p>
		        <li>Put the card in the mailbox.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The users can put their hand-written postcard directly into the mailbox built into the machine.
		          </p>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The postage fees are paid by the Hong Kong Alzheimer’s Disease Association.
		          </p>
		        <li>Receive and separate the postcards.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            Days later, the recipient receives the postcard in one piece - one half has been written on, while the other is empty. They tear along the dotted line to separate the postcards. They keep the half with the message (the half with the photo) and use the empty half (the half with the word search) to reply.
		          </p>
		        <li>Write a reply.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            On the word search side, the recipient circles the word they would like to fill in the blank with. Then they flip the card over to write the message they would like to send back to the original sender.
		          </p>
		        <li>Mail the reply.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            Finally, the recipient puts their half in the mailbox to send back to the original sender.
		          </p>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The postage fees are again paid by the Hong Kong Alzheimer’s Disease Association.
		          </p>
		        <li>Continue communication.</li>
		          <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
		            The sender would receive the reply from the recipient, therefore encouraging them to continue communicating with the recipient.
		          </p>
		      </ol>

			      Our installation takes advantage of the long waiting times tourists experience at the airport. These longer periods of time mean that the user wouldn’t mind spending more time at the booth, and they also provide more time for reflection. Therefore, we opted to put a short video and game in between the photo uploading and printing. The video’s short duration and emotional appeal would keep the user from getting bored while watching, and the simplicity of the game afterwards keeps the user from getting frustrated. The two-way postcard not only helps reconnect distant families, but it also serves as a reminder of the experience at the booth.
		      </p>

		      <p>
			      Because our intervention is meant to help the elderly, we incorporated postcards and word searches into our design. Postcards appeal to the elderly since they are tangible, nostalgic, sentimental, and familiar. The postcards can also be framed and displayed in their homes. Their portability and relatively low cost make them easier to send to other countries than other souvenirs, such as clothes. As for word searches - they help mentally stimulate the elderly. Additionally, they also provide the recipient with a chance to say something they may not be comfortable saying in person, such as "I love you."
