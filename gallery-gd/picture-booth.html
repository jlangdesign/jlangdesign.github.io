            <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
            <p>
            Picture Booth is a photo-printing installation in airports that raises public awareness about dementia. It educates users about the condition and urges them to spend more time with their family, which could offset or potentially
help prevent dementia. First, the user uploads a photo from their travel to print. While the photo is printing, the user is invited to watch a short video about dementia. The photo then prints in the form of a two-way postcard, giving a chance for the user to write a message to their family and (re)connect with them.
            </p>
            <p>
            In short, Picture Booth aims to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Raise public awareness towards dementia.</li>
                <li>Encourage people to spend more time with their families.</li>
                <li>Create a happy, meaningful moment within families.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h1 class="story-chapter">Mission</h1>
            <p>
            Design a public installation to raise awareness of, generate empathy for, and urge for action towards a global issue. The installation is located in Hong Kong and is designed for tourists.

            <p>
            Picture Booth turns your travel photos into a learning opportunity and a chance to connect with your family. Its free photo-printing service and bright colors draw the tourist (the user) in. First, the user uploads a photo that they would like to print. Then, as the photo is printing, they watch a documentary about dementia and play a game related to the documentary. The realistic documentary introduces the topic and triggers the user's emotions, while the game simulates memory loss from dementia (to an extent). Both activities let the user know that they can still help those with dementia, despite the lack of a cure. Once the user has learned how it feels to be a caretaker and a dementia patient, the photo is printed out as a two-way postcard. Finally, the user can then write a message to their loved ones, send the postcard to them, and reflect on the experience while waiting for their flight. This postcard acts as the first step in re-connecting adults and their elderly parents, which would help fight dementia.

            Detailed flow:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Welcome the users and introduce it as a free photo printing booth.</li>
                <li>Show the printing steps + privacy policy statement.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The user uploads a photo from their phone to the machine wirelessly.
                    </p>
                <li>Show that the photo from the phone is being received by the machine.</li>
                <li>Show that the photo is being processed.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    (Inform them they can enjoy a short video while waiting.)
                    </p>
                <li>Play a short documentary.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    It is an emotional documentary of a man struggling to care for his mother, who had dementia. The user can see how stressful it is. Despite the fact that there is no cure for dementia, the video urges people to help by taking care of their aging relatives.
                    </p>
                <li>Start a short game.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The user plays a short memory game related to the video’s contents after watching the video. Each question asks the user to correctly recall a specific detail from the video (e.g. What color was the man’s hat?). These questions were meant to catch the user off-guard, since they probably don’t remember these small details.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    After the game, Picture Booth explains that the struggle they just experienced - trying to remember simple details - is what those with dementia suffer from every day.
                    </p>
                <li>Receive the photo, which has been turned into a two-way postcard.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The user should be surprised to see that their photo is now a postcard.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    Both sides of the paper are split into two parts. The front has the photo on the left half and a word search on the right. The back has two sections for writing messages and addresses - one to send, and one to receive in response.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The machine then gives instructions for using the postcard and tells them to go to the back of the installation (where there is a counter and pens) to begin writing. There are also instructions on the back of the installation.
                    </p>
                <li>Write the message.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The users write their message on the half that is behind the photo. The other half (behind the word search) is left blank for the recipients to reply with.
                    </p>
                <li>Put the card in the mailbox.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The users can put their hand-written postcard directly into the mailbox built into the machine.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The postage fees are paid by the Hong Kong Alzheimer’s Disease Association.
                    </p>
                <li>Receive and separate the postcards.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    Days later, the recipient receives the postcard in one piece - one half has been written on, while the other is empty. They tear along the dotted line to separate the postcards. They keep the half with the message (the half with the photo) and use the empty half (the half with the word search) to reply.
                    </p>
                <li>Write a reply.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    On the word search side, the recipient circles the word they would like to fill in the blank with. Then they flip the card over to write the message they would like to send back to the original sender.
                    </p>
                <li>Mail the reply.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    Finally, the recipient puts their half in the mailbox to send back to the original sender.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The postage fees are again paid by the Hong Kong Alzheimer’s Disease Association.
                    </p>
                <li>Continue communication.</li>
                    <p style="margin: 0% 5%">
                    The sender would receive the reply from the recipient, therefore encouraging them to continue communicating with the recipient.
                    </p>

            Our installation takes advantage of the long waiting times tourists experience at the airport. These longer periods of time mean that the user wouldn’t mind spending more time at the booth, and they also provide more time for reflection. Therefore, we opted to put a short video and game in between the photo uploading and printing. The video’s short duration and emotional appeal would keep the user from getting bored while watching, and the simplicity of the game afterwards keeps the user from getting frustrated. The two-way postcard not only helps reconnect distant families, but it also serves as a reminder of the experience at the booth.
            </p>

            <p>
            Because our intervention is meant to help the elderly, we incorporated postcards and word searches into our design. Postcards appeal to the elderly since they are tangible, nostalgic, sentimental, and familiar. The postcards can also be framed and displayed in their homes. Their portability and relatively low cost make them easier to send to other countries than other souvenirs, such as clothes. As for word searches - they help mentally stimulate the elderly. Additionally, they also provide the recipient with a chance to say something they may not be comfortable saying in person, such as "I love you."

The Java program scales, crops, and rotates the image to put in the postcard template. Construct is used to make the screens interactive.
