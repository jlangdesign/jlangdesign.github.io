            <h1 class="story-section">Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Living in a foreign country and having to learn a new language can be daunting, especially if the culture and language seem drastically different from your own. 慢慢go! (read as “maan maan go!”) seeks to educate English-speaking foreigners living or traveling in Hong Kong about the local culture - including pop culture - while allowing them to absorb language in a casual, simple manner on the go. Each publication would contain a variety of materials in both Hong Kong Cantonese and English, such as news articles, reviews, and stories - to keep learning interesting. These texts wouldn’t be too lengthy, but rather they would make light reading during breakfast or your daily commute. What makes 慢慢go! different from other language-learning resources is that it provides Cantonese reading material with unintrusive side-by-side English translations. This makes it easy to refer to the English if you get stuck reading the Cantonese. No longer do you have to interrupt your reading session to Google translations of various Cantonese phrases (which, by the way, are hard to find when all the Chinese learning materials are for Mandarin).

                Conceptualize a system for a text-dominant publication containing subject matter of your choosing. Then, test the system - demonstrate how the layouts, roles, and rules vary with the content yet maintain a consistent style.

                Exploring Chinese typography has always been one of my biggest interests for some reason. I suppose it's because it seems so different from typography with Latin characters. Another (related) interest I have is learning Cantonese. I'm passionate about spreading the Cantonese language and culture, but one of the biggest barriers is the lack of Cantonese learning (especially reading) material online. Most of the learning materials for Chinese languages are for Mandarin, and it's quite frustrating to conduct searches for Cantonese terms but receive pages full of unrelated results in Standardized/Mandarin Chinese. That's why I thought an intervention that makes it easier for English-speakers to learn to read Cantonese would be handy.

                I began searching for similar publications for inspiration, but I wasn't able to find many. I learned that bilingual magazines already exist. Some had certain articles exclusively in one of the two languages and felt more disparate. Others had side-by-side versions of the same article in English and the other language. With this knowledge, I rapidly sketched thumbnails of sample spreads, trying to figure out how to express the two sides. How would articles or spreads be divided? Would they flow into each other, or parallel to one another? Should the layout be a bit more artsy and interesting at the cost of functionality? Many of my ideas explored different orientations, having the Cantonese version of the article flow into the English version, and side-by-side comparisons. The side-by-side versions appeared to make the most sense. Once I exhausted my creative juices on thumbnail ideation, I worked on flatplans. These were straightforward. I mostly focused on figuring out how to divide the subject matter and how to indicate different sections. Finally, I thought I was ready to start making digital mockups. But then, I realized that I still didn't have a name and masthead for my publication!
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, I came up with names such as "Immerse" and "Absorb" to reflect how readers would gradually learn to read Cantonese by "immersing" themselves in the articles. But these names didn't sit right with me. Since the publication represented the intersection of English and Cantonese and was about Hong Kong culture, I thought it would be fitting if the name contained a mixture of English and Cantonese. It would be like the "Kongish" Hongkongers are known for speaking. I remembered how my mom would tell me to "慢慢揸車," or "drive carefully" all the time. This in turn made me think of other phrases with "慢慢" (slowly, leisurely). Eventually I took "慢慢行" ("take it easy") and translated it it into "慢慢go!". Readers could take it easy while learning and read these short articles on the go. When sketching ideas for the masthead, I used round typefaces to feel more casual. After input from some classmates, I linked the characters together to resemble cursive and represent the smooth transition between Cantonese and English.
            </p>
            <p>
                At last, I could begin creating digital cover and publication drafts! I decided to start with an 8x8 grid because not only is 8 a lucky number in Chinese culture, but having more columns to work with offers more flexibility. One of the main issues I had was trying to keep the Cantonese separate yet related to the English. Both of them commanded your attention equally, so it was hard to focus on the Cantonese text. In my first draft, I tried to remedy this by making the English text a lighter green. However, the English still looked too similar to the Cantonese. Thus, I made the English translations much lighter and smaller and turned it into "sidebars" corresponding with each Cantonese paragraph. Only then was it clear was that the Cantonese was the main reading text. Designing this publication also made me realize how dependent I am on imagery - I felt the need to include a lot to add visual interest. I thought that using them to break up the text would make reading seem less daunting, but they also broke the flow of reading. Eventually, I reduced the number of images used and put the remaining images in the outer squares of the grid so they would be less obstructive. From there, I tweaked the layouts so the publication system would feel clean and consistent while also varying slightly based on the type of article. This was a tough decision to make. While I wanted the layout to be more fun, I felt that ease of reading was more important. The point was to make learning/reading less frustrating, not to be artsy. Of course, I threw in a few extra articles as well so the publication would feel "real."

                慢慢go! contains reading material in English and Cantonese, with an emphasis on the latter. Each issue contains four sections: "News," which consists of short news articles; "Features," which is composed of more in-depth articles about various subjects; "Reviews," which contains reviews of films, technology, and the like; and "Writings," which is made of prose and poetry. The different sections provide a variety of content to keep reading interesting.
            </p>
            <p>
                The structure of each article is fairly similar. The Cantonese text is in the center, while the English translation appears in light green text in "sidebars." Keywords are highlighted in green in the Cantonese and bolded in the English. These help the reader find their place in the Cantonese and deduce the meaning of the rest of the text via contextual clues. A square marker indicates the end of an article, and a triangle marker indicates that an article is more than a spread long. Both of these symbols can help readers see how long an article is and therefore help them determine which articles they want to read.
