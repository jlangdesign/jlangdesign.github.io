			    <h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
			    <p>
			    	Explore the wonderful bizarre, trippy world of Katie Hall through this book! Designed based off of hand mannerisms Katie displays while creating her creatures, Of Lizards and Cat-thingies allows readers to read and learn with
						their eyes and hands! Each spread, full of color and illustrations, features a creature in need as well as a hand interaction (e.g. coloring, rotating, sweeping, etc.) based on Katie’s actions. Your goal is to help all the creatures come to life by performing these interactions.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        	The book’s folding system is essentially two accordion books nested into each other and united in the back. So you
						would flip main pages in alternating directions - up, down, up, down...The actions featured in this book are from research conducted for a previous project in which we had to study how people use their hands in certain contexts and create a video about them. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/FJnbnYi7h1E" target="_blank" class="links">My video about Katie can be found here</a>.
	        </p>

			    <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Mission</h4>
	        <p>
	        Create an interactive "handbook for hands" that teaches the reader about someone else's usage of hands. Break down the usage of hands!
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Playthrough</h4>
	        <p>
		        Since my book is about Katie's hands, I knew it had to be wild and bizarre. From my previous study of her drawing, I chose the most important actions she performed - coloring, rotating, passing, erasing, sharpening, sweeping, and signing. I then thought about how those actions could be abstracted, differentiated, and made more fun. It made sense to make the user interact with her creatures too as if they were learning how to draw them, Katie-style. To push the weirdness, I had to devise a folding structure more complicated than a standard 2-page spread. Eventually, I ended up with this confusing accordion-brochure amalgamation (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtu.be/cFOqyeSokoI" target="_blank" class="links">prototype of unfolding here</a>). But that was okay because one of Katie's signature lines is, "Don't make me make sense!"
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        After some extensive prototyping, storyboarding, and style (visual and voice) development, the only thing left was to actually build the book. Having to make all the interactions function correctly was the most difficult (and frustrating) part. I wasn't even sure if the book would close properly because there were so many layers! But I think doing another project like this would be worthwhile - it's interesting to explore interactions with surfaces that are not screens.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Results</h4>
	        <p>
		        The final book is a treasure chest full of pleasant, nested surprises. It begins by introducing you to the different steps that you - the artist - must take to create like Katie. Then, each spread afterwards features one of Katie's characters (each with a distinct personality) and the action/task you must perform to help them come to life. It seems like a children's book, but I believe other people could enjoy it too, just in a different way. While a kid would just enjoy the weird interactions and fun graphics, an adult would understand the analogies and wit behind it. And I think the idea the concept of reading with more than one sense is compelling. Why aren't there more interactive books like this? They could make learning easier (especially if you're a kinesthetic or auditory learner) since you're more immersed or make reading more enjoyable. Physical books don't have to be antiquated - they can still have a place in society.

		        Unfortunately, I have been unable to obtain a video of the book being "read" due to lack of equipment so far, but I'll make sure to do that soon! Here are descriptions of the spreads, their respective interactions, and the actions from the Katie that inspired them:
	        </p>
	        <div style="margin: 0% 10%">
	          <p>
	            Mini spread (Contents page): Each flap features a character you will encounter in the book. Open each flap to reveal the hand interaction that character is associated with.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Color (Groovy Turtle): Pull the pencil slider along the zigzag slot will add color to Groovy Turtle's shell. This resembles Katie shading/rendering in a tight, continuous zigzag stroke.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Rotation (Cowfish): Slide Cowfish along the spiral groove and rotate the page to read the text following the spiral. This conveys two ways to rotate a piece - rotating the entire canvas or spinning a small object with your finger.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Baton pass (Juggle Bear): Swat Porky the Pig, Unilizard, Cowboy Cat, Jock Roach, and Ridiculox back and forth between your hands as fast as you can. This represents Katie passing objects from her non-dominant hand to her dominant hand.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Erase (Monopoguin): Pull the sliders down one by one to gradually lighten Monopoguin's suit. This emulates highlighting with short, repeated strokes.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Sharpen (Flaming Spider): Open the “pencil bag” (the mini spread), pull on the tabs to pop the “pencil sharpener” (box with slits) up, and push the strip of paper into the side slot until the creature comes out the top slot. On one side of the strip is Trippy Moose; on the other is Musicat. This shows how sharpening a pencil sharpens the lines of a drawing and increases color contrast.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Sweep (Allllieuuughhhh): Swat each flap of paper back until it rolls out all the way and the fly disappears. This simulates swiping eraser crumbs off drawings.
	          </p>
	          <p>
	            Finish (Everyone): Pick up the rainbow pencil and sign anywhere on the page. Unicorn sprinkles will fall out of the pencil as you do this. To put the sprinkles back in the pencil more easily, pull the top of the pencil open. This shows that signing a piece is the final magical touch (garnish). It marks the end of drawing and the tedious process of cleaning up the workspace.
	          </p>
