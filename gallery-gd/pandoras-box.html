	        <h3 class="story-section">Overview</h3>
	        <p>
	          Welcome! This web display functions as an informative wiki page for a fictional game called Pandora’s Box - an
	          augmented reality RPG. It contains multiple inventories, each with interactive elements (elements that change upon
	          clicking or hovering) and multiple levels of navigation to improve the user experience. These aspects encourage
	          the user to explore the webpage to see what the different elements do, making the user feel like he/she is playing
	          a game to learn more about a game.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          Pandora’s Box is an augmented reality RPG, meaning that the game augments the real world we’re living in with
	          these digital characters, places, items, etc. It’s also location-based, meaning that players living in different
	          areas will see different things. That’s why there are multiple levels of navigation relating to location. First,
	          you have the “World Map” tab in the navigation bar on the top. This expands so you can pick a continent and then a
	          country. After you pick a country, you are taken to a map of the country, where you can then pick a region. That
	          will then take you to a page all about that region. In the case of this webpage, the user picked “North America”
	          for the continent, “USA” for the country, and “Bamboo Forest” for the region. Pages for each region around the
	          world would be of a similar structure to this page.
	        </p>
	        <p>
	          This web display is merely supposed to show what a sample webpage of a larger site would look like. There aren’t
	          any active hyperlinks (except for the logo, which takes you back to my professor’s website, and the title, which
	          reloads the same page), but clicking on different parts of the “Contents” and “Jump to” bars will take you to
	          their respective sections of the page.
	        </p>

	        <h3 class="story-section">Process</h3>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Mission</h4>
	        <p>
		        Make a web display using HTML and CSS that features pictures of items in an inventory, regular site-wide navigation and identifying elements, and explanatory text. Use hover states to create another layer of interaction. Make sure it displays correctly on your computer.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Playthrough</h4>
	        <p>
		        One of the things that I like the most about games is exploring their complex worlds and elements. Therefore, I thought it would be fun to create a wiki-style web display all about a certain item in a game. I looked at precedents such as Bulbapedia to see how elements were organized and came up with the idea of a bestiary for a location. Then I examined bestiaries in video games to determine what information to include about each beast. Somehow, that didn't seem like enough variety to me, so I expanded my idea to include other sections, such as "People" and "Gallery." This opened up more interaction possibilities to me.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        Next, I had to plan out which items to depict, their different hover states, and the overall aesthetic. I didn't want each item to have the same type of hover state (e.g. simply turning darker or growing bigger), so making them different took quite a bit of work. Not only did I have to use the hover states to reflect the information in the explanatory text, I had to make sure the images were of a consistent height and width. As for the visual style, I wanted the web display and graphics to have a classic fantasy RPG feel, yet I needed a hint of contemporary because it's augmented reality. Thus, most of the visuals use muted colors and browns and are highly detailed. They were digitally rendered, though they have a hand-drawn quality to them. I also used Alegreya throughout the page because it was script-like yet still contemporary.
	        </p>
	        <p>
		        The actual coding wasn't too difficult. I consulted W3Schools often to learn how to render certain elements, such as tables and inline images. I didn't plan out the entire website before coding - rather, my approach was more playful. I would create one section, see how it looked on a browser, make small changes if necessary, and moved on to the next section. By far the hardest part was getting the hover states of the map to work correctly. I had to have three layers for the map - the background, the yellow hover states, and the text labels. When the user hovers over one of the text labels, the hover states would shift based on the selected name.
	        </p>

	        <h4 class="story-chapter">Results</h4>
	        <p>
		        What I ended up with was a web display full of different actions to explore. The user feels compelled to try hovering over or clicking on everything to see what happens because all the items seem to behave differently. For instance,the map glows based on which territory you're hovering over, the picture in the "About" section changes between day and night when you click on it, and the Bestiary monsters change states when you hover over them to reflect the information in their description. There is lots of scrolling, but there are multiple layers of links to facilitate navigation. Currently, the big map only displays correctly on my computer, so that is something I'd like to fix (once I figure out how to do so, that is).
